Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

[9] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic.

[10][11] The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei.

[12] As of 17 July 2020, more than 13.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 592,000 deaths.

More than 7.77 million people have recovered.

[8]
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.

[13][5][6][14] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[15] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.

[16][17][18] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.

[5][19]
The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.

[6][20][22] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.

[6][23] Transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.

[24] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.

[6][20] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.

[6][20] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

[25] Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.

[26][27]
Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.

[7][28][29] The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use.

[30][31] Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.

[32][33]
Fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19,[13] but is highly variable in severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having fever at all.

[39][40] In one study, only 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.
