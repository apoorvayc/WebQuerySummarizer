Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[9] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic.[10][11] The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei.[12] As of 17 July 2020, more than 13.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 592,000 deaths. More than 7.77 million people have recovered.[8]
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.[13][5][6][14] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[15] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.[16][17][18] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[5][19]
The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.[6][20][22] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.[6][23] Transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[24] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[6][20] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.[6][20] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[25] Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.[26][27]
Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[7][28][29] The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use.[30][31] Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.[32][33]
Fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19,[13] but is highly variable in severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having fever at all.[39][40] In one study, only 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.[41]
Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.[13][1][5][42] Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.[43][44][45] Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions.[46] Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.[47] A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.[48][49] Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.[14][50]
An early key to the diagnosis is the tempo of the illness. Early symptoms may include a wide variety of symptoms but infrequently involves shortness of breath. Shortness of breath usually develops several days after initial symptoms. Shortness of breath that begins immediately along with fever and cough is more likely to be anxiety than COVID-19. The most critical days of illness tend to be those following the development of shortness of breath.[55] A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[56] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not fully known.[57][58] Preliminary evidence suggested they may contribute to the spread of the disease.[59] In June 2020, a spokeswoman of WHO said that asymptomatic transmission appears to be "rare," but the evidence for the claim was not released.[60] The next day, WHO clarified that they had intended a narrow definition of "asymptomatic" that did not include pre-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (weak symptoms) transmission and that up to 41% of transmission may be asymptomatic. Transmission without symptoms does occur.[56]
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[10][16][61][62] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.[63]
A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that "the risk for severe COVID-19 was 45% higher for people with type A blood than those with other blood types."[64][65]
Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[68] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[69][70]
People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).[22] They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.[22] People can also transmit the virus without showing any symptom (asymptomatic transmission), but it is unclear how often this happens.[6][20][22] A June 2020 review found that 40–45% of infected people are asymptomatic.[71]
COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.[22][72] The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance;[6] the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 metres (6 ft).[20] Transmission may also occur through aerosols, smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[24] Some medical procedures performed on COVID-19 patients in health facilities can generate those smaller droplets. Some outbreaks have also been reported in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor locations where infected persons spend long periods of time (such as restaurants and nightclubs).[73] Aerosol transmission in such locations has not been ruled out.[24]
The virus may occur in breast milk, but it's unknown whether it's infectious and transmittable to the baby.[83][84]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[85] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[86] Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[26]
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[87] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[46] In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in the binding domain of the S protein between the coronaviruses from pangolins and those from humans; however, whole-genome comparison to date[when?] found that at most 92% of genetic material was shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.[88]
SARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brainstem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the central nervous system (CNS). While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[94][95][unreliable medical source?]
The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[96] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[97][unreliable medical source?]
Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[103][better source needed] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients in both China and New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[104]
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[108] The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[109] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[25][110] Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.[111][112] Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.[113] Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.[10][114][115] As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.[116][117][118] Antibody tests may be most accurate 2–3 weeks after a person's symptoms start.[119] The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.[120] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.[121] The absence or presence of COVID-19 signs and symptoms alone is not reliable enough for an accurate diagnosis.[122]
Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count.[123]
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[139][140][141][142]
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[143][30][144] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[30][145] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[30][145] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[146][147][148][149]
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[150] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[140] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[140]
Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.[151] Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.[152] After the implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many regions have been able to sustain an effective transmission rate ("Rt") of less than one, meaning the disease is in remission in those areas.[153]
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing. The CDC further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.[140] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis". Glycerol is added as a humectant.[154]
Sanitizing of frequently touched surfaces is also recommended or required by regulation for businesses and public facilities; the United States Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of products expected to be effective.[156]
On 7 July 2020, the WHO said in a press conference that it will issue new guidelines about airborne transmission in settings with close contact and poor ventilation.[157]
For health care professionals who may come into contact with COVID-19 positive bodily fluids, using personal protective coverings on exposed body parts improves protection from the virus.[158] Breathable personal protective equipment improves user-satisfaction and may offer a similar level of protection from the virus.[158] In addition, adding tabs and other modifications to the protective equipment may reduce the risk of contamination during donning and doffing (putting on and taking off the equipment).[158] Implementing an evidence-based donning and doffing protocol such as a one-step glove and gown removal technique, giving oral instructions while donning and doffing, double gloving, and the use of glove disinfection may also improve protection for health care professionals.[158]
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.[159][160][161] The CDC recommends those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.[32] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[citation needed][162] Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.[163] Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.[164]
Some studies have found that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be helpful in early screening for severe illness.[228]
The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.[234] Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.[235] This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.[236]
There are several theories about where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[247] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year old citizen in the Hubei province. There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were "patient zero".[12] By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[170][248] The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[249] and at least 266 by 31 December.[250] On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[251] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[252] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[253] Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January),[254] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[255]
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases[256][257][258]—enough to trigger an investigation.[259]
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[260] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[261] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[262] Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[263] and more may have been infected.[264] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".[265][266] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.[264] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[267]
On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[268] As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[269] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths.[270] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[271] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[272] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[273][274] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[275]
On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case,[276] Beijing reported the first COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[277] By 15 June, 79 cases were officially confirmed.[278] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[276][279]
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[280] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.[281]
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.3% (592,573/13,885,746) as of 17 July 2020.[8] The number varies by region.[282]
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.[283]
Infection fatality rate (or infection fatality ratio) is distinguished from case fatality rate. The case fatality rate ("CFR") for a disease is the proportion of deaths from the disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease (within a certain period of time). The infection fatality ratio ("IFR"), in contrast, is the proportion of deaths among all the infected individuals. IFR, unlike CFR, attempts to account for all asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections.
Our World in Data states that, as of 25 March 2020, the infection fatality rate (IFR) for coronavirus cannot be accurately calculated.[288] In February, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.33% and 1%.[289][290] On 2 July, The WHO's Chief Scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.[291][292]
The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4% (0.2% to 1%) and that 35% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26% (as of 20 May).[293][294] The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May).[295] According to CEBM, random antibody testing in Germany suggested a national IFR of 0.37% (0.12% to 0.87%).[295][296][297] To get a better view on the number of people infected, as of April 2020, initial antibody testing had been carried out, but peer-reviewed scientific analyses had not yet been published.[298][299] On 1 May antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of 0.86%.[300]
Firm lower limits of infection fatality rates have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,266 individuals (18,652 confirmed and 4,614 probable) have died with COVID-19 (0.28% of the population).[301] In Bergamo province, 0.57% of the population has died.[302]
Early reviews of epidemiologic data showed greater impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in China and Italy.[303][1][304] The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.[305] Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[306][307] One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[308]
In the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans.[309] Structural factors that prevent African Americans from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in "essential" occupations such as public transit and health care. Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care and of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease also increase their risk of death.[310] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities.[309] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.[311] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.[312] Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[313]
In the U.K., a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred in those of a Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority background.[314][315][316] Several factors such as poverty, poor nutrition and living in overcrowded properties, may have caused this.[citation needed]
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",[317][318][319] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[320][321] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,[322] Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.[323]
In January 2020, the World Health Organisation recommended 2019-nCov[324] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[325] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma.[326][327][328]
The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38% fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40% fewer in Spain.[334] The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital."[335] There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment.[335] Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions.[336] In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, attributable to COVID-19 quarantines and social distancing measures.[337][338] Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic.[339][340][341] The pandemic has also negatively impacted mental health globally, including increased loneliness resulting from social distancing.[342]
A study on domesticated animals inoculated with the virus found that cats and ferrets appear to be "highly susceptible" to the disease, while dogs appear to be less susceptible, with lower levels of viral replication. The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.[346]
In March 2020, researchers from the University of Hong Kong have shown that Syrian hamsters could be a model organism for COVID-19 research.[347]
There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand. To minimise the harm from misinformation, medical professionals and the public are advised to expect rapid changes to available information, and to be attentive to retractions and other updates.[354]
Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.[360]
In June, initial results from a randomised trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for patients who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.[374] Because this is a well tested and widely available treatment this was welcomed by the WHO that is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids.[375][376] Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the National Institutes of Health for patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.[377]
The Feinstein Institute of Northwell Health announced in March a study on "a human antibody that may prevent the activity" of IL-6.[389]
The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia,[8] and has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States and Brazil[9] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May, 200,000 on 3 June, [10][11] and 1,000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020.
India's case fatality rate is relatively lower at 2.80%, against the global 4.7%, as of 6 July.[12] Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country – Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[13] As of 24 May 2020, Lakshadweep is the only region which has not reported a case. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time reducing 49% of total infections[14] followed by recovery rate crossing 60% till early July. Although, active have continued to increase persistently.
On 22 March, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi. It was followed by mandatory lockdowns in COVID-19 hotspots and all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the Prime Minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India. On 14 April, the PM extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May which was followed by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17 May with substantial relaxations. From 1 June, the Government has started "unlocking" the country (barring "containment zones") in three unlock phases.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21]
The United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have praised India's response to the pandemic as 'Comprehensive and robust,' terming the Lockdown restrictions as aggressive but vital for containing the spread and building necessary healthcare infrastructure. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) noted the government's swift and stringent actions, emergency policy making, emergency investment in healthcare, fiscal stimulus, investment in vaccine and drug R&D. It gave India a score of 100 for its strict response. Michael Ryan, chief executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme noted that India had tremendous capacity to deal with the outbreak owing to its vast experience in eradicating smallpox and polio.[22][23][24] In June, India was ranked 56th of 200 countries in COVID 19 safety assessment report by Deep Knowledge Group.[25] Though, other commentators have also raised concerns about the economic fallout arising as a result of the pandemic and preventive restrictions.[26][27] The lockdown was justified by the government and other agencies for being preemptive to prevent India from entering a higher stage which could make handling very difficult and cause even more losses thereafter.[28][29]
On 12 January 2020, the WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[30][31]
Jan 30 Jan 30 Feb 2–21 Feb 2–21 Mar 2–31 Mar 2–31 Apr 1–30 Apr 1–30 May 1–31 May 1–31 Jun 1–26 Jun 1–26 Last 21 days Last 21 days
On 30 January, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Kerala, which rose to three cases by 3 February; all were students returning from Wuhan. Apart from these, no significant rise in transmissions was observed in February. On 4 March 22 new cases were reported, including 14 infected members of an Italian tourist group.[38][39]
In March, the transmissions grew after several people with travel history to affected countries, and their contacts, tested positive. On 12 March, a 76-year-old man, with a travel history to Saudi Arabia, became the first COVID-19 fatality of India.[40]
A Sikh preacher, who had a travel history to Italy and Germany, turned into a "super spreader" by attending a Sikh festival in Anandpur Sahib during 10–12 March.[41][42] Twenty-seven COVID-19 cases were traced back to him.[43] Over 40,000 people in 20 villages in Punjab were quarantined on 27 March to contain the spread.[42][44]
On 31 March, a Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation event in Delhi, which had taken place earlier in March, emerged as a new virus super spreader event, after numerous cases across the country were traced back to it. On 18 April, the Health ministry announced that 4,291 cases were directly linked to the event.[45][46]
On 2 May, in Punjab, around 4,000 stranded pilgrims returned from Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra. Many of them tested positive, including 27 bus drivers and conductors who had been part of the transport arrangement. Till 13 May, 1,225 pilgrims had been tested positive.[47][48][49]
The outbreak has been declared an epidemic in more than a dozen states and union territories, where provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 have been invoked, leading to the temporary closure of educational and commercial establishments. All tourist visas have been suspended, as a majority of the confirmed cases were mainly imports.[50]
Protective measures were first applied in January.

By early to mid-March, the government had drawn up plans to deal with a worsening of the pandemic in the country. This included seven ministries working together to set up additional quarantine and treatment facilities across the country. States and twenty ministries, including Home, Defence, Railways, Labour, Minority Affairs, Aviation and Tourism, were informed of the containment plan.[56] Plans to avoid a panic-like situation were also made. The Ministry of Textiles was to ensure the availability of protective and medical materials. The Department of Pharmaceuticals was to ensure the availability of essential medicines. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution was asked to ensure availability of essentials.[57]

On 4 April, the Government of India banned the export of hydroxychloroquine "without any exception", to stockpile supplies for domestic use.[124] The United States, which imports half its supply of the drug from India and expects to use it for treating COVID-19 patients, grew concerned. The US President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Modi the next day, and hinted at possible retaliation in a press conference. India agreed to allow its export on "humanitarian grounds".[125] Apart from the US, India had outstanding orders for hydroxychloroquine from some 30 countries, including Brazil, Spain, France, UK, Germany, Australia, the Gulf countries and the SAARC neighbours. The decision to partially lift the ban preceded President Trump's comment on possible retaliation.[126]
On 11 April, India sent a team of 15 doctors and health care professionals to Kuwait to assist in its fight against coronavirus, following a telephone conversion between prime minister Modi and the Kuwaiti prime minister Sabah Al-Khalid Al-Sabah.

On 10 May the Indian government sent Naval ship INS Kesari, which carried medical teams, essential medicines and food items to the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles following separate requests for help in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.[130] [131]
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology launched a smart phone application called Aarogya Setu to help in "contact tracing and containing the spread" of COVID-19 pandemic in the nation. The World Bank lauded the early deployment of such technology to combat the pandemic. Amid growing privacy and security concerns, the government released the source code of the app, making it open-source on 26 May. The Government has promoted voluntary adoption of the app in its guidelines and standard operating procedures.[132][133][134]
The Union Health Ministry's war room and policy making team in New Delhi consists of the ministry's Emergency Medical Response Unit, the Central Surveillance Unit (IDSP), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and experts from three government hospitals.[138] They are part of policy decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the country.[138] A cluster-containment strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how India contained previous epidemics, as well as "breaking the chain of transmission".[138][139][140] 15 labs across India led by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, are testing for the virus, with more labs being trained, as of early March.[141] On 14 March 65 labs were named capable for testing for the virus (though as of 17 March not all are fully functional).[142][143][144]
On 14 March, scientists at the National Institute of Virology isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus. By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus after China, Japan, Thailand and the US.[145] The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that isolation of the virus will help towards expediting the development of drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country.[146] NIV has shared two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with GISAID.[147] On 16 April, China sent 650,000 testing kits to India[148] but their use was discontinued in view of a very low accuracy (of just 5.4%).[149] In May, National Institute of Virology introduced another antibody test kit ELISA for rapid testing, capable of processing 90 samples in a single run of 2.5 hours.[150]
Initially, the labs tested samples only from those with a travel history to 12 countries designated as high-risk, or those who have come in contact with anyone testing positive for the coronavirus, or showing symptoms as per the government guidelines.[151][152] On 20 March, the government decided to also include all pneumonia cases, regardless of travel or contact history after the country saw a sharp increase in the number of cases.[153] The first and second confirmatory tests for the virus has been made free by the government.[154] On 9 April, ICMR further revised the testing strategy and allowed testing of the people showing symptoms for a week in the hotspot areas of the country, regardless of travel history or local contact to a patient.[155]
The Ministry of Health said that only 10 per cent of test capacity had been used per day till 15 March,[154] claiming that the number of tests was enough. However experts thought they were not, saying that community transmission may go undetected without adequate testing.[143] They also wanted to add more testing centres by inclusion of private laboratories.[143][152] In mid-March the government authorised accredited private labs to test for the virus.[156]
On 17 March, the Union Ministry of Health had decided to allow private pathology labs to test for COVID-19. The ministry official claimed that by allowing private labs, the work of testing can be doubled. The ministry said that NABL accredited laboratories may soon be allowed.[157] Once set up, a person can get COVID-19 test done at a private lab after a qualified physician in a government facility recommends it.[158] The ICMR has appealed to the private labs to offer the tests for free as the government labs do.[157]
On 19 March, Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy stated that India could be facing a "tsunami of cases within a few weeks" as testing increases and the reason for the low number of confirmed cases currently is due to under-testing. He also said that according to mathematical models applied in the US or UK at least 20%–60% of the population will be affected. Applying the same models in India means that at the lower end of the estimate there could be 300 million cases of which 4–8 million could be severe.[162]
On 13 April, ICMR advised pool testing in the low infection areas with a positivity rate less than 2% to increase the capacity of the testing and save resources. In this process maximum five samples are tested at once and samples are tested individually only if a pool tests positive.[167] Andaman and Nicobar Islands[168] and Uttar Pradesh[169] have started doing pool testing.
On 14 April, ICMR and DGCI approved 18 new suppliers of test kits that included three Indian firms, bringing the total suppliers to 51.[170]
On 16 April, 650,000 rapid antibody test and RNA extraction kits were dispatched from China, and over 2 million kits were to be sent in next 15 days.[149] On 21 April, Health department of West Bengal alleged that large number of testing kits supplied by ICMR-NICED (National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases) were giving inconclusive results. ICMR-NICED admitted that there was problem in the kits and said that they are addressing the issue.[171] While Rajasthan stopped using rapid testing kits as they were giving low accuracy of 5.4% in compared to expected 90% accuracy.[172] Later, ICMR advised all states to stop using rapid testing kits for next two days until their on-ground teams validates these kits.[173] Rapid antibody test kits were put on hold till further notice. The Chinese manufactures of the rapid testing kits said that the testing kits were approved by ICMR and the problem is not with the kits but with the way they were being used. However, Chinese manufacturers promised to cooperate with Indian authorities to resolve the issue.[174][175] Amid this, ICMR asked states to return the faulty kits which will be sent back to the Chinese suppliers and cancelled the order of all remaining kits.[176][177]
Testing for community transmission began on 15 March. 65 laboratories of the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) have started testing random samples of people who exhibit flu-like symptoms and samples from patients without any travel history or contact with infected persons.[178][179] As of 18 March, no evidence of community transmission was found after results of 500 random samples tested negative.[180] Between 15 February and 2 April, 5,911 SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses) patients were tested throughout the country of which, 104 tested positive (1.8%) in 20 states and union territories. About 40% of the identified patients did not have travel history or any history of contact with a positive patient.[181] The ICMR advised to prioritise containment in the 36 districts of 15 states which had reported positive cases among SARI patients.[182]
In Rajasthan, a combination of anti-malaria, anti-swine flu and anti-HIV drugs resulted in the recovery of three patients in March.[183] In the same month, the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Cipla launched a joint venture to develop anti-COVID-19 drugs.[184] Another Indian firm, Stempeutics, announced plans to introduce a stem cell-based agent for treating critical COVID-19 patients.[185] Following randomised clinical trials, another Indian firm Biocon got its novel biologic therapy by use of a newly formulated intravenous drug for treatment of patients.[186]
In March, a startup incubated in Pune's SciTech Park introduced 'Airon', a negative ion generator capable of reducing a room's viral load by 99.7%.[187] In April, funds for a number of preventive agents were released to initiate research.[188][189]
On 23 March, the National Task Force for COVID-19 constituted by the ICMR recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of high-risk cases.[190]
According to estimates, India has around 40,000 ventilators, of which 8,432 are with the public sector.[191] Various Indian PSUs, firms and startups, including DRDO and ISRO, have since repurposed their production lines to manufacture general PPEs, full body suits and ventilators. They are also designing low-cost or mobile medical equipment.[192][193][194][195] The focus was to increase the production of low-cost, compact and portable ventilators that could cater to multiple patients at a time. This led to the creation of some of the world's smallest and cheapest ventilators.[196] The government aims to double the current capacity of ventilators by June 2020 with the assistance from PSUs. The government has also requested major private automakers to explore the possibility of manufacturing ventilators at their plants.[197] Maruti Suzuki, in collaboration with AgVa Healthcare, will supply 10,000 ventilators till end of the May.[198] From nil in near past, India was producing around 200,000 PPE kits and 250,000 N95 masks per day in May 2020.[199] By second half of month, India had emerged as world's second largest producer of PPE body coveralls.[200]
The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has been working on genome sequencing of COVID-19.[201] In May, CCMB also started a partnership with a private company Eyestem Research to grow novel coronavirus strain in human lung epithelial cells for research and trials of anti-viral drugs.[202]
On 12 April, the ICMR invited health institutions and hospitals to participate in trials of convalescent plasma therapy and plasma exchange therapy. Later, the ICMR submitted a list of such institutes to the DCGI to start trials,[203] which the DCGI approved.[204] Several states were allowed by ICMR to start clinical trials of the plasma therapy.[205][206] In Delhi, a 49-year-old man who was on ventilator support became the first patient in the country, who recovered through plasma therapy in April.[207] Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that the initial results of the plasma therapy treatment on four patients gave positive and encouraging results, adding that they had decided to conduct it on three more patients.[208] However, the ICMR later stated that there is no robust evidence to support convalescent plasma therapy as a routine therapy, describing it is as an emerging and experimental therapy. It has some risks, which include life-threatening allergies and lung injuries. The ICMR have since started multi-centre clinical trials to ensure the treatment's safety and efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients across the country.[209]
Pune-based Serum Institute of India announced that it would apply for clinical trials of certain strains from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April. As per company president Adar Poonawalla, a vaccine for COVID-19 will be delivered within a year. However, it may not be effective on 20 to 30% people.[210] Two other companies are also trying to develop a vaccine: Zydus Cadila, which is replicating viral vector and developing a DNA plasmid vaccine,[211] and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with US based FluGen, which is expecting the first clinical trials of a nasal vaccine by late 2020.[212] As of late February, the Serum Institute of India had begun animal trials of vaccine candidates,[213] followed by Zydus Cadila in March.[214] ICMR partnered with Bharat Biotech in May to develop COVID vaccine completely in India.[215] Till May, there were over 30 candidates of COVID-19 vaccine in development in India, many of which were already in pre-clinical tests.[216] Four vaccines were expected to enter fully clinical trials in August–October.[217] Per reports emerged in July, ICMR was preparing to launch BBV152 COVID vaccine or Covaxin , India's first COVID-19 vaccine on 15 August following its ongoing human trials in July.[218] Although, later deadline was cited as only meant to cut "red tape" and expected timeline of any Indian vaccine not to be before 2021.[219] In mid-July, Zydus Cadila too had followed with human trials of its vaccine named ZyCoV-D.[220]
On 19 March, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the closure of all restaurants in the capital by 31 March in view of the ever increasing case of coronavirus.

The Ministry of Textiles stated that India was producing no Personal Protective Equipment kits before the pandemic. By May 2020, it began producing an average of 150,000 PPE kits per day.[358]
The Nizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program (Ijtema) in Nizamuddin West, Delhi in March.[359][360][361] The Delhi Government's order against organising seminars, conferences or any big event (beyond 200 people) was apparently ignored by the organisation, and the Delhi Police also failed to enforce it.[362][363] The gathering emerged as one of India's major coronavirus hotspots.[364] The entire Nizamuddin West area was cordoned off by the police as of 30 March, and medical camps were set up.[365] On 18 April, the Central Government stated that 4,291 cases (or 29.8% of the total 14,378 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India) were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, and these cases were spread across 23 states and Union Territories.[366] As of 4 April, about 22,000 people who came in contact with the Tablighi Jamaat missionaries had to be quarantined.[367]
Hyderabad witnessed panic buying throughout 20 and 21 March.[368] Panic buying of milk and other dairy products was also reported.[369][370] Online grocery delivery service Grofers also witnessed panic buying across states.[371]
Retailers and consumer goods firms saw their average daily sales more than double on 19 March as consumers rushed to buy essentials ahead of PM Narendra Modi's address to the nation.[372] In response to this, Modi assured the citizens that there was enough food and ration supplies and advised them against panic buying.[373]

On 13 March in Telangana, one woman returned from Singapore has been missing, while a man who came from Doha went somewhere without telling hospital staff.[380]
Despite evidence to the contrary, a viral rumour spread online alleging that only people who eat meat were affected by coronavirus, causing "#NoMeat_NoCoronaVirus" to trend on Twitter.[381] To curb these rumours and combat declining sales, some poultry industry associations held a "Chicken and Egg Mela" in Hyderabad. Several Telangana state ministers were in attendance and ate some of the free eggs and fried chicken being distributed at the event to show their support for the industry.[382]
A Muslim cleric stated that Allah has punished the Chinese by unleashing coronavirus on them for their brutal crackdown on Uighur Muslims.[383] The Chinese consulate in Kolkata also condemned similar statements reportedly made by Dilip Ghosh, president of the West Bengal unit of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.[384]
Some politicians claimed that drinking cow urine and applying cow dung on the body could cure coronavirus.[385][386] WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan rubbished such claims and criticised these politicians for spreading misinformation.[387][388]
Reports of harassment of people from Northeast India, which shares a border with Tibet and Myanmar, in Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad were reported following the outbreak.[389][390][391] Students from Kirori Mal College in Delhi, Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai and other institutes in Kolkata have also faced harassment and filed complaints with authorities.[392][393][394]
Misinformation that the government is spreading "anti-corona" drug in the country during Janata curfew went viral on social media.[395] Film actor Mohanlal and many others shared the fake news that, the vibration generated by clapping together during Janata curfew will kill the virus.[396] One viral message says that the lifetime of coronavirus is only 12 hours and staying home for 14 hours during Janata curfew break the chain of transmission.[397] Another message claimed that observing Janata curfew will result in the reduction of coronavirus cases by 40%.[397] A tweet by Rajinikanth claiming that a 14-hour stay home can stop the coronavirus disease going from "stage 2" to "stage 3" was classified as misinformation and was taken down by Twitter for violating community guidelines.[398] Amitabh Bachchan was heavily criticised for one of his tweets, which claimed vibrations from clapping, blowing conch shells as part of Sunday's Janata Curfew would have reduced or destroyed coronavirus potency as it was ‘amavasya’, the darkest day of the month.[399]
Residents of a village named Korauna in Sitapur district in Uttar Pradesh faced discrimination due to similarity in name of the village with the virus.[400]
Some doctors and medical workers were evicted from their homes over fears they may be carrying coronavirus. In cases reported across the country, healthcare professionals described the growing stigma they are facing from their neighbours and landlords, resulting in many being refused taxis, barricaded from their own homes, or made homeless.[401][402]
In March 2020, foreigners from countries such as UK, US and Israel were facing hostility, including evictions from rented homes.[403]
Some patients, in different quarantine facilities of Uttar Pradesh, refused to eat food because the cooks in these facilities were Dalits.[404][405]
The Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi and the resulting hotspot triggered Islamophobic reactions and increased communal tension.[406][407][408] Islamophobic hashtags began circulating shortly after the news broke in late March.[409]
Rajasthan Congress MLA Bharat Singh Kundanpur in a letter to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot claimed that "when coronavirus can be removed by washing hands with alcohol, then drinking alcohol will surely remove virus from the throat." His claim was rubbished by several health experts and doctors.[410]
Three Sikh men in Chembur, Mumbai were brutally attacked by a stranger for asking him to wear a mask while in public places as ordered by the government. One man was later admitted to a nearby hospital. This incident gave rise to Sikh-Muslim communal tension in the area. The accused was arrested by Mumbai Police.[411][412]
Ramdev claimed that one can treat coronavirus by pouring mustard oil through the nose, making the virus flowing into the stomach, resulting in its ultimate death by the acid present in the stomach. He also claimed that if a person holds his breath for a minute, it means s/he is not suffering from any type of coronavirus, symptomatic or asymtomatic. Both these claims were found to be false.[413][414]
When migrant workers returned to their hometowns and villages following the loss of employment in cities, they were treated with class bias. In some cases, they were hosed down with disinfectants or soap solution.[415] They were feared to be carrying coronavirus from the urban areas where they had been employed.[416] Since many of them belonged to the lower castes, they had to face caste slurs.[417]
A report titled "India: Media’s Crackdown during COVID-19 Lockdown" was published on 15 June 2020. Many sources state that at least 55 journalists have been heavily cracked down on for reporting on COVID-19, with FIRs being filed against them under various Acts. [418][419][420][421][422] The charges have been levied for reporting starvation faced by migrant workers, the failure of the administration to supply rations, mismanagement and negligence at quarantine centres[421], or any other reporting that is construed as 'anti-government'.

On 4 April 2020, it was reported that 15 Indians died abroad due to COVID-19. The 15 dead people included 6 in the United States, 5 in Italy, 2 in United Arab Emirates and one each in Egypt and Iran.[425] It was reported on 6 April that four Indians who belonged to the state of Kerala, died in abroad due to COVID-19. The four people were 54-year-old nurse in Ireland, 21-year-old student in New York, 51-year-old employee in Queens, New York and 41-year-old driver in Saudi Arabia.[426] On 11 April, it was reported that over 1,500 Indian Americans were infected and more than 40 Indian Americans and Indian nationals died due to the disease.[427] The Ministry of External Affairs have confirmed that there are 3,336 confirmed Indians cases abroad and 25 have died as of 16 April across 53 countries.[428] On 24 April, the NHS revealed that at least 420 people of Indian origin died due to the disease.[429] On 26 April, officials confirmed that the confirmed cases of Indians abroad has increased to 6,300 with 40 deaths.[430]
As of 19 May, the NHS England reported that 695 members of the non-white community categorised as ‘Indian’ died due to the disease.[431] On 25 May, it was reported that a 50-year-old Indian school teacher of Hindi subject who worked at a school in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, died due to the disease.[432]
On 7 June, it was reported that a 61-year-old Indian doctor, who worked at a hospital in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, died.[433] According to the study of the University of Edinburgh, Indians and South Asians in the UK are likely to die due to COVID-19.[434] As of 25 June 763 people of Indian origin died in the UK, according to the NHS.[435]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.[9][15][16] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[17] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[18][19] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.[9] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.[20]
Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, disinfecting surfaces, increasing ventilation and air filtration indoors,[21] and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.[9][22] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.
The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,[23] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression[24] and global famines affecting 265 million people.[25] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,[26] widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,[27][28][29] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.[30][31] Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 172 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 percent of the world's student population.[32] Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media.[33] There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[34]
On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) got reports from health authorities in China of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,[341][342] and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.[343] On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.[344][7]
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[354][355] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[356][357][358] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.[359][360]
The WHO recognised the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020[8] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly surpassed China's.[361]
Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[362] As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population.[363] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[364][365] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.[366] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[367][368]
On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[369] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[370][371] However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[372]
Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[373] It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[374] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults.[375] Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.[376]
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[377] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[378] R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[379]

Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[384] As of 17 July 2020, approximately 592,000[5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June, about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[385]
The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[386] The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[387] and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.[388]
Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[389] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting.[390] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[391][392] In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal.[391] This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[393]
Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[394] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[395][396][397] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[398] Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[399]
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.3 percent (592,573 deaths for 13,885,746 cases) as of 17 July 2020.[5] The number varies by region.[400]
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known.[398] In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94 percent (95-percent confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China.[401][402] The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.[403] The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 1.1 percent and that 40 percent of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.65 percent (0.5 to 0.8 percent).[404][405] Serology-informed IFR in Geneva, Switzerland is 0.64 percent (0.38 to 0.98 percent).[406]

On 11 March 2020, the WHO said the pandemic could be controlled.[8] The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be."[409] The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".[410] William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is "so readily transmissible", it "might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.[411]
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.[9][413] Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible.[414] As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 percent.[415]
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.[416][17][16]
Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.[9] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[16] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.[17]
People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).[12] They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.[12] People can also transmit the virus without showing any symptom (asymptomatic transmission), but it is unclear how often this happens.[9][10][12] A June 2020 review found that 40–45% of infected people are asymptomatic.[417]
COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.[12][418] The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance;[9] the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 metres (6 ft).[10] Transmission may also occur through aerosols, smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[14] Some medical procedures performed on COVID-19 patients in health facilities can generate those smaller droplets. Some outbreaks have also been reported in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor locations where infected persons spend long periods of time (such as restaurants and nightclubs).[419] Aerosol transmission in such locations has not been ruled out.[14]
COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.[434][435]
The standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[436]
A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.[437] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.[438]
On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new "spit test" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48 hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs, and could enable people to conduct it at home.[439]
Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[440] Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[441] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.[440] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.[435]
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.[442][443] Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.[444][445] Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.[446][447]
Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from areas affected by the outbreak.[448] The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.[449]
Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.[450] There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organisations are working to develop one.[451]
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[22] CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.[442] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[443][452] It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.[453]
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[443][454][455] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[456][457] Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.[458]
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10.[459] On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.[460] A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.[455]
Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.[461][462]
In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.[463][464] Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.[465][466]
The CDC and WHO recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[467][468][469] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[468][470] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[468][470] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[471][472]
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[473] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[442] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[442] Healthcare professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.[474]
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[476][477]
Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.[478][479] The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.[480] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[9][18][481]
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.[482] Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used.[21] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[483]
The CDC recommends ventilation of all public spaces to help dilute and clear out potentially infectious aerosols.[21][484] This can be achieved by increasing the percentage of outside air, increasing the total airflow to occupied spaces, disabling demand-control ventilation (DCV) controls, and using natural ventilation (e.g., opening windows and doors if possible and safe).[21] The CDC recommends bathroom fans be working and at full capacity when people are in a building.[21]
The CDC recommends enhancing filtration in heating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as part of an overall risk mitigation plan, which should be designed in consultation with a professional or it may be counterproductive.[21] Doctors have been cautious about recommending air filtration because of the potentially very small size of virus particles; some filters are labelled to remove viruses to the 5-micron level, but some virus particles may be even smaller.[485] The CDC recommends increasing air filtration as high as is possible (MERV 13 or 14) without reducing design airflow; this may require replacing the current HVAC system with one that can better handle such filters, which create more resistance to air flow.[21] Other recommendations include using appropriate, correctly installed filters, running ventilation systems continuously, and creating separate ventilation zones for higher and lower risk areas of the building (e.g., individual offices on a different zone than office gym).[21] Another option may be to add freestanding air cleaners, especially in areas where virus particles are likely to be most concentrated.[21][486] In July, researchers at the University of Houston said they had designed a filter using nickel foam which used heat to kill the virus.[487] Some experts have recommended UV light inside HVAC systems.[488]
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression) and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.[493] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[494] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.[410]
Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[489] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[489] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[495]
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.[496] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.[497]
Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.[410]
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.[498] The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.[499]
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.[499] (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)[499]
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.[500][501] The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.[502] In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.[503]
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.[504] The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.[504][505] In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.[506][507][508]
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.[509][510] In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.[511][512][513] On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.[514][515]
Antiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19[516] None has yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials.[516] However, remdesivir may affect the time it takes to recover from the virus.[517] Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1 May, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19.[518] The interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments, and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks.[518][519]
Taking over-the-counter cold medications,[520] drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.[442] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.[521] The safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a treatment option requires further research.[522]
Other trials are investigating whether existing medications can be used effectively against COVID-19 or the immune reaction to it.[516][523] On 16 June, the RECOVERY Trial group released a statement that their preliminary results show low dose dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients receiving respiratory support,[524] though previous reviews had suggested the use of steroids may worsen outcomes.[525] Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint.[526]
There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[527] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province.[359] There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were "patient zero".[359] Starting from December, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[528] and at least 266 by 31 December.[529]
According to official Chinese sources, these early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[346] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.[530]
On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[531] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[532]
On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January),[533] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[534] That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[535] The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases[341][536][537]—enough to trigger an investigation.[343]
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[538] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[432] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[539] A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later)[540] and more may have been infected.[541] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".[356][542] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.[541] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times[clarification needed].[543]
On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[544] As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[545] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.[546] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[547] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[548] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[549][550] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[551]
On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being officially reported,[552] the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[553] As for 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed.[554] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[552][555]
On 29 June 2020, WHO warned that the spread of the virus is still accelerating as countries reopen their economies, although many countries have made progress in slowing down the spread.[556]
As of 17 July 2020, more than 13.8 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 592,000 people have died and more than 7.77 million have recovered.[557][558]
A total of 188[5] countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far. Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.[559] National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).[560]
By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown,[561] which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.[562][563]
By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.[564] Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States,[565] around 100 million people in the Philippines,[564] about 59 million people in South Africa,[566] and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.[567][568] On 21 May 100,000 new infections occurred worldwide, the most since the start of the pandemic, while overall 5 million cases were surpassed.[569]
As of 19 May 2020, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases.[570][571] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly South Korea,[572] Taiwan,[573] and Vietnam,[574] has allowed them to fare comparatively well.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan;[354] one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.[359] Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 December, upon which her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[575][576] Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.[575] A public notice was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December, confirming 27 cases and suggesting wearing face masks.[537] The WHO was informed on the same day.[341] As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.[577] The Chinese National Health Commission initially said there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.[578] In a 14 January conference call, Chinese officials said privately that human-to-human transmission was a possibility, and pandemic preparations were needed.[579] In a briefing posted during the night of 14–15 January, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out.[580]
On 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus.[581] That same day, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and State Council premier Li Keqiang issued their first public comments about the virus, telling people in infected areas to practice social distancing and avoid travel.[582][583] During the Chinese New Year travel period, authorities instigated a City of Wuhan lockdown.[584] On 10 February the Chinese government launched a radical campaign described by paramount leader and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi as a "people's war" to contain the viral spread.[585] In "the largest quarantine in human history",[586] a cordon sanitaire on 23 January stopped travel in and out of Wuhan,[587][588] then extended to fifteen Hubei cities affecting about 57 million people.[589] Private vehicle use was banned in the city.[590] Several Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were also cancelled.[591] Authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, completed in ten days.[592] Leishenshan Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.[593] China also converted other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.[594]
On 26 January, the government instituted further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.[596] Universities and schools around the country were also closed.[597][598][599] The regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities.[600] Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions.[601] Travel restrictions were enacted in and outside of Hubei.[601][602] Public transport was modified,[603] and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.[601][604][605] Control of public movement was applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction.[606] In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs.[607] Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.[608][609]
After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus re-entering China from other countries. For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.[610] At the same time, a strong anti-foreigner sentiment quickly took hold,[611] and foreigners experienced harassment by the general public[612] and forced evictions from apartments and hotels.[613][614]
On 24 March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.[615] The same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.[616] The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end. Those wishing to enter China must to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.[617][618] The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for firms.[619]
The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 4 April, coinciding with Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online in observance of physical distancing to avoid a renewed COVID-19 outbreak.[620] On 25 April the last patients were discharged in Wuhan.[621] On 13 May the city of Jilin was put on lockdown, sparking fear of a second wave of infection.[622]
The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia,[623] and has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States and Brazil[624] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May, 200,000 on 3 June, [625][626] and 1,000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020.
India's case fatality rate is relatively lower at 2.80%, against the global 4.7%, as of 6 July.[627] Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country – Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[628] As of 24 May 2020, Lakshadweep is the only region which has not reported a case. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time reducing 49% of total infections[629] followed by recovery rate crossing 60% till early July. Although, active have continued to increase persistently.
On 22 March, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi. It was followed by mandatory lockdowns in COVID-19 hotspots and all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the Prime Minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India. On 14 April, the PM extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May which was followed by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17 May with substantial relaxations. From 1 June, the Government has started "unlocking" the country (barring "containment zones") in three unlock phases.[630][631][632][633][634][635][636]
Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February.[658][659] More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.[659][660] The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March.[661] On 15 March, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.[662] At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March.[663] By 23 March, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.[664] According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.[665] The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.[666] On 20 April it was reported that Iran had reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country, though there is a fear of the second wave of infection due to this move.[667] After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June, raising fear of a second wave.[668]
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February,[669] largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.[669][670] Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.[671][672] By 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms.[673]
South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.[674] On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported,[675] rising to 3,150 on 29 February.[676] All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.[671] Airline schedules were also changed.[677][678]
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.[572][679] Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application,[680] drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day,[681] and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.[682] South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.[572][683][684]
South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis, many signing petitions either praising it or calling for impeachment.[685] On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.[682] On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.[686] Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.[687] On 15 May it was reported that about two thousand businesses were told to close again when a cluster of a hundred infected individuals was discovered; contact tracing is being done on 11,000 people.[688]
As of 13 March 2020, when the number of new cases became greater than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[689][690] Cases by country across Europe had doubled over periods of typically 3 to 4 days, with some countries (mostly those at earlier stages of detection) showing doubling every 2 days.[691]
As of 17 March, all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case.[692] At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City.
As of 18 March, more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe.[693]
On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.[699] Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas."[700][701]
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April,[702] but on 9 March all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.[703] On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.[704][705]
On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.[706][707][708] On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.[709][710] On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.[711] As of 12 June, there were 236,305 confirmed cases, 34,223 deaths, and 173,085 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.[361] A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.[712] On 19 April, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses are asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.[713]
The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands.[714] Post-hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by mid-February.[715] By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country.
The lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020.[716] On 29 March, it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days.[717] By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded the most cases and deaths in the country. Medical professionals and those who live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates.[718] On 25 March, the death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China, and only that of Italy was higher.[719] On 2 April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period—at the time, the most by any country in a single day.[720] On 17 May, the daily death toll announced by the Spanish government fell below 100 for the first time,[721] and 1 June was the first day without deaths by coronavirus.[722] The state of alarm ended on 21 June.[723]
Prior to 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.[732][733] As a result, the government was criticised for a perceived lack of intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.[734][735]
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.[736][737] On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible,[738] and promised to pay up to 80 percent of workers' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.[739]
On 23 March, the prime minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings. Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for those deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations, and garages.[740]
On 24 April it was reported that one of the more promising vaccine trials had begun in England; the government has pledged, in total, more than 50 million pounds towards research.[741]
To ensure UK health services had sufficient capacity to treat people with COVID-19, a number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.[742] The first to be operational was the 4000-bed capacity NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed within the ExCeL convention centre over nine days.[743] On 4 May, it was announced that the Nightingale Hospital in London would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities.[744] This followed reports that NHS Nightingale in London "treated 51 patients" within the first three weeks of opening.[745] On 5 May, official figures revealed that Britain had the worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The death toll in the United Kingdom was nearly 29,427 (of those who tested positive for the virus). Later, it was calculated at 32,313, after taking the official death count for Scotland and Northern Ireland into account.[746] On 16 April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.[747]
Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.[549][550] A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.[748][749]
On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places,[750] and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May.[751][752][753] As of 23 April, France has reported more than 120,804 confirmed cases, 21,856 deaths, and 42,088 recoveries,[754] ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.[755] In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.[756] On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.[757]
Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.[758] Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favoured forgoing a lockdown in an attempt to reach herd immunity.[759] The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.[758][760] On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.[761]
On 20 January 2020, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who had returned from Wuhan on 15 January.[762] On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency,[763] and restricted entry for travellers from China who were not U.S. citizens.[764]
On 28 January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they had developed their own testing kit.[765] Despite this, the United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the extent of the outbreak.[766][767] Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government test kits, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test.[766][767]
By 2 March there were 80 confirmed cases, half of them in California. Florida and New York had declared their first two cases and the state of Washington reported many suspected cases and the first death. Vice President Pence maintained that the threat of the virus spreading throughout the U.S. was small.[768][769][770]
On 6 March, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.[771][772] Corporations encouraged employees to work from home.[773] Sports events and seasons were cancelled.[26]
On 13 March, Trump declared a national emergency, which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis.[774] Beginning on 15 March, many businesses closed or reduced hours[775] and schools across the country were shutting down.[776][777] By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia.[778] On 26 March, the United States had more confirmed cases than any other country.[547] U.S. federal health inspectors surveyed 323 hospitals in late March; reporting "severe shortages" of test supplies, "widespread shortages" of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results.[779]
On 22 April, it was reported that two Californians had died from the virus (not, as previously thought, influenza) on 6 and 17 February, three weeks before the first official COVID-19 death in the U.S. had been acknowledged.[551] By 24 April, 889,309 cases had been confirmed and 50,256 people had died.[780] As of 17 May, according to a New York Times database, more than 1,474,600 people had been infected and at least 88,600 had died in the United States. The Times said that prior to 29 April only deaths confirmed through testing were reported, but new criteria include probable cases and deaths. As of 17 May, the U.S., which accounts for about 4.25 percent of the world's population, had about 29 percent of the confirmed coronavirus deaths.[781]
The White House has been criticised for downplaying the threat and controlling the messaging, directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence.[782] On 14 April, President Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), saying they mismanaged the pandemic. He also said the U.S. would not participate in a global effort with the WHO to develop a vaccine and drugs to combat the virus.[783] On 1 May the CDC presented a 17-page report titled "Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework" to the administration, written to provide advice for faith leaders, places of business and other public places, educators, and state and local officials as they reopened. The White House refused to use the report, and Trump said he felt the guidelines were too restrictive, commenting "I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was."[784][785]
By mid-May reports of new cases began to level off and most states began to open restaurants and other places of business, placing limits to the numbers of people allowed in the establishment at the same time. The head of the NIAID, Anthony Fauci, warned that if caution was not used the rate of infections could rebound and he was particularly concerned about opening the schools in the fall. President Trump expressed disapproval of Fauci's statements, saying "To me it's not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools."[786] By mid-June, new cases began to rise once again, with increases in the percent of positive tests and number of hospitalizations occurring in states such as Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona.[787] On 12 July, almost 6 months after the first case was recognised in the U.S., the highest single day case record of 15,300 infections were recorded in Florida.[788]
On 6 July 2020, the United States president Donald Trump's administration sent a notice to the United Nations Secretary General António Guterres to withdraw from the World Health Organization. The notice of withdrawal was to come in effect from 6 July 2021, under the terms of a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1948, where United States was required to give one-year notice and clear its debts to leave the WHO.[789]
On April 17, the highest number of cases and deaths was registered in Brazil,[792] followed by Peru and Chile in the number of confirmed cases.[793]
On May 13, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of infection with 23,091 deaths. On May 22, citing especially the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the WHO declared that South America is presently the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.[794][795]
On 20 May it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.[797] On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created a great deal of controversy referring to the virus as a "little flu" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has so closely matched that of U.S. president Donald Trump he has been called the "Trump of the Tropics".[798]
In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths. On 5 June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths. The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of previous 24 hours. The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths.[799] On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.[800]
According to Michael Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, early detection is vital because the continent's health systems "are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks".[801][802] Advisers say that a strategy based on testing could allow African countries to minimise lockdowns that inflict enormous hardship on those who depend on income earned day by day to be able to feed themselves and their families. Even in the best scenario, the United Nations says 74 million test kits and 30,000 ventilators will be needed by the continent's 1.3 billion people in 2020.[803] Most of the reported cases are from six countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria, but it is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in other African countries with poorer health care systems.[804] Cases have been confirmed in all African countries, with Lesotho the last country to report its first coronavirus case on 13 May 2020.[805] There have been no reported cases in the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.[806]
On 19 May 2020, Australia filed a motion with the UN for an inquiry into the origins of the virus, and the response of the UN and governments. More than 100 countries supported this motion, and it was passed unanimously.[809][810]
As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas,[811] or for all travellers.[812] Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.[813] A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.[814] Researchers concluded that "travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late".[815]
The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy,[816][817] a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.[818][819]
Owing to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India,[820] Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.[821] Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.[822][823] On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.[824] Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.[825]
On 15 February, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess,[826] and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.[827] In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.[828][829] On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.[830]
Some Chinese students at American universities sent aid, including 50,000 N95 masks on 30 January.[831] The humanitarian aid organisation Direct Relief sent 200,000 face masks and other personal protective equipment to the Wuhan Union Hospital the same day.[832] On 5 February, the Chinese foreign ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China,[833] and Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts and protect "at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia".[834] Interaksyon said the Chinese government had donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6 February after Philippine senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.[835] On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send $2.26 million worth of aid to China.[836]
Several countries donated masks, medical equipment or money to China, including Japan,[837] Turkey, Russia,[838] Malaysia,[839] Germany,[840] and Canada.[841][842] The U.S. State Department said on 7 February it had facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China.[843] The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to aid their fights against the virus,[844] though on 21 March China said it had not received epidemic funding from the U.S. government and reiterated that on 3 April.[citation needed] Several corporations have also donated money or medical equipment to China.[845]
After cases in China stabilised, the country began sending aid to other nations.[846] In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak;[847][848] China sent three medical teams and donated more than forty tons of medical supplies to Italy.[849] Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union.[850][851] He later sent 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ventilators to Panama.[852]
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concerns over Chinese-made masks and test kits.[853] For instance, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of 30 percent, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks which were said to be defective,[854] but China said this was due to misuse.[855] Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China but were in fact from Colombia.[856] The Philippines stopped using test kits donated by China due to their 40 percent accuracy.[857] The Chinese government said product instructions might not have been followed, and that some products were not purchased directly from certified companies.[858] Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa.[859][860] On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.[861] According to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Turkey provides the largest amount of humanitarian aid in the world while ranking third worldwide in supplying medical aid.[862][863]
Taiwan posted an inquiry to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[864][865] The WHO has commended the Chinese authorities for providing "regular updates", contrasting it to the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak when they were accused of secrecy.[866] The WHO said on 5 January that cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported,[867] and issued technical briefings on 10 and 11 January warning of risks of human-to-human transmission and urging precautions due to the similarity to earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks.[868] though in public announcements it said there was "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission" as late as 14 January.[869] On 20 January, the WHO said it was "now very clear" human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had occurred, given that healthcare workers had been infected.[870] On 27 January, the WHO assessed the risk of the outbreak to be "high at the global level".[871]
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), warning that "all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread" of the virus,[7][872] following an increase in cases outside China. This was the sixth-ever PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems" but that the WHO did not "recommend limiting trade and movement".[7][873][874]
On 11 February, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide the "power of the entire UN system in the response". A UN Crisis Management Team was activated, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations, which the WHO said will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak".[875] On 25 February, the WHO declared "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," stating that while it was too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be "in a phase of preparedness".[876] On 28 February, WHO officials said the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.[877] On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.[878] The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".[8] Critics have said the WHO handled the pandemic inadequately and that the PHEIC and pandemic classification came too late.[879] The third meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee on 30 April renewed the declaration of PHEIC for the second time.[880]
The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes. One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.[881] Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China.[882][883] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08)[884] and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent.[885] On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook.[886] Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.[887] Many consider an economic recession likely.[888][889]
Lloyd's of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season and 9/11, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.[890]
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed.[891] The cruise line industry was hard hit,[892] and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.[893] International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.[894]
The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.[895] Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop.[896] This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February. Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.[897]
Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally.[898][899] More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims.[900] According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.[901]
The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.[902] The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust).[903] The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.[904] According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.[905][906] It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.[907]
The impact of the coronavirus outbreak was worldwide. The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine. The Yuancheng Group, headquartered in Wuhan, China, is one of the leading suppliers.[908] Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the street of the UK.[909] U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors.[910]
The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis.[911][912] David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said "we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months."[913]
Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve, for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020.[914][913][915]
In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.[916] On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.[917] June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.[917]
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.[918] In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.[919][920][921]
Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.[920] Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.[922][923][920] With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims,[920] other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.[920] Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed,[650][657] while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.[924][925]
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War. Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League,[926] 2019–20 Premier League,[927] UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season,[928] and 2019–20 NHL season.[929] The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that they will be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021".[930][931]
The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.[932][933] The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in the Netherlands in May, was cancelled, however the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021.[934][935] Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.[936] Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts[937] or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work.[938] Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.[939]
The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities,[940] isolations or deaths of multiple politicians,[941] and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.[942] Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus.[943]
Although they have broad support among epidemiologists, social distancing measures have been politically controversial in many countries. Intellectual opposition to social distancing has come primarily from writers of other fields, although there are a few heterodox epidemiologists.[944]
The measures taken to combat the pandemic are part of an unusually large expansion of government power. Advocates of small government worry that the state will be reluctant to give up that power once the crisis is over, as has often been the case historically.[945]
The Chinese government has been criticised by the United States government,[946] UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove,[947] and others[948] for its handling of the pandemic. A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine measures in China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak. Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.[949] The U.S. intelligence community says China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases.[950] The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.[951][952]
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy[953][954]—Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said "only China responded bilaterally", not the EU.[955] On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.[956] President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.[957] Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.[958] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."[959] In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant,[960] and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country.[961]
The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.[963][964][965] Political analysts anticipated it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election.[966][967] Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.[968]
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.[969][970] The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying "it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating."[971]
The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.[660][972] Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.[973] Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.[974]
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.[976] South Korea criticised Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.[977] South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.[685]
Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic. Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.[978][979] In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.[980] In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.[981] In some countries, including Egypt,[982] Turkey,[983] and Thailand,[980] opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.[984]
The pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production. As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis "of biblical proportions",[985] or "hunger pandemic".[986] It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that "12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger" by the end of 2020.[14][985][987] This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019-20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way.[988] 55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario.[989] 265 million people are forecast to be in famine conditions, an increase of 125 million due to the coronavirus pandemic.[14]
The pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities and colleges.[990]
Most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19.[991] As of 7 June 2020, approximately 1.725 billion learners are currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 134 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 38 are implementing local closures, impacting about 98.5 percent of the world's student population. 39 countries' schools are currently open.[992]
On 23 March 2020, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) released a statement announcing the cancellation of Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International AS & A Level, Cambridge AICE Diploma, and Cambridge Pre-U examinations for the May/June 2020 series across all countries.[993] International Baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled.[994] In addition, Advanced Placement Exams, SAT administrations, and ACT administrations have been moved online and cancelled.
School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families.[995] but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences.[996][997] School closures in response to the pandemic have shed light on various social and economic issues, including student debt,[998] digital learning,[999][1000] food insecurity,[1001] and homelessness,[1002][1003] as well as access to childcare,[1004] health care,[1005] housing,[1006] internet,[1007] and disability services.[1008] The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.[32][1009]
The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38 per cent fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40 per cent fewer in Spain.[1011] The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital."[1012] There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment.[1012] Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions.[1013]
In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, attributable to COVID-19 quarantines, social distancing measures, and recommendations to not engage in casual sex.[1014][1015] Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic.[1016][1017][1018]
The worldwide disruption caused by the pandemic has resulted in numerous impacts on the environment and the climate. The considerable decline in planned travel[1021] has caused many regions to experience a large drop in air pollution. In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25 per cent reduction in carbon emissions[1022] and 50 per cent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions,[1023] which one Earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months.[1024][1025] Other positive impacts on the environment include governance-system-controlled investments towards a sustainable energy transition and other goals related to environmental protection such as the European Union's seven-year €1 trillion budget proposal and €750 billion recovery plan "Next Generation EU" which seeks to reserve 25% of EU spending for climate-friendly expenditure.[1026][1027][1028][1029][1030]
However, the outbreak has also provided cover for illegal activities such as deforestation of the Amazon rainforest[1031][1032] and poaching in Africa,[1033][1034] hindered environmental diplomacy efforts,[1035] and created economic fallout that some predict will slow investment in green energy technologies.[1036]
Since the start of the outbreak, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent.[1037][1038][1039] Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people deserving the virus.[1040][1041][1042] Chinese people and other Asians in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.[1043][1044][1045] U.S. president Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" and "Kung Flu", which critics say is racist and anti-Chinese.[1046][1047][1048][1049]
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,[1050][1051] as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.[1052] Paris has seen riots break out over police treatment of ethnic minorities during the coronavirus lockdown.[1053] Racism and xenophobia towards South Asians and Southeast Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[1054][1055][1056] South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.[1057][1058]
In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been inflamed by the pandemic; a comic posted on Weibo described foreigners as "foreign garbage" targeted for "disposal".[1059] Some black people were evicted from their homes by police and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.[1060] Other harassment, discrimination and evictions of Africans in China were alleged.[1061] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by foreign governments and diplomatic corps and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.[1062] A McDonald's branch in Guangzhou barring blacks sparked anger in China and overseas, and McDonald's closed the location.[1063]
Many newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their coronavirus-related articles and posts,[1064] while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.[1065] Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.[1066]
The pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease.[1068][1069][1070] False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media,[1069][1071] text messaging,[1072] and mass media,[1073] including the tabloid media,[1074] conservative media,[1075][1076] and state media of countries such as China,[1077][1078] Russia,[1079][1080] Iran,[1081] and Turkmenistan.[1069][1082] It has also been reportedly spread by covert operations backed by states such as Saudi Arabia,[1083] Russia and China to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries.[1084][1085][1086][1087] In some countries, such as India,[1088] Bangladesh,[1089] and Ethiopia,[1090] journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic.[1091]
Misinformation has been propagated by celebrities, politicians[1092][1093] (including heads of state in countries such as the United States,[1094][1095] Iran,[1096] and Brazil[1097][1098]), and other prominent public figures.[1099] Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests, supposed preventives, and "miracle" cures.[1100][1101] Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus.[1102][1103][1104] Some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory,[1105][1106] a population-control scheme, the result of a spy operation,[1070][1071][1107] or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks.[1108]

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei. As of 17 July 2020, more than 13.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 592,000 deaths. More than 7.77 million people have recovered.[1]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Colloquially known as simply the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Read more...
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days. There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Read more...

The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis. Global stock markets crashed in March 2020, with falls of several percent in the world's major indices. As the pandemic spreads, global conferences and events across technology, fashion, and sports are being cancelled or postponed. While the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing. Read more...
Hazard controls for COVID-19 in US workplaces are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task, based on an occupational risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected person with COVID-19. Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task. Read more...
The pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media, text messaging, and mass media, including the tabloid media, conservative media, and state media of countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and Turkmenistan. It has also been reportedly spread by covert operations backed by states such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and China to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries. In some countries, such as India, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia, journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic. Read more...
COVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. The two main branches detect either the presence of the virus or of antibodies produced in response to infection. Tests for viral presence are used to diagnose individual cases and to allow public health authorities to trace and contain outbreaks. Antibody tests instead show whether someone once had the disease. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. It is used to assess disease prevalence, which aids the estimation of the infection fatality rate. Read more...

In July 2020, 205 vaccine candidates were in development, with 21 in human testing: one as a Phase II-III interventional trial using thousands of participants, two in Phase II efficacy and dose-testing studies, five in Phase I–II safety and efficacy trials, and thirteen in Phase I trials.[7][8][9]
A clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an "adaptive design" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.[44][45] The WHO Solidarity trial of multiple vaccines in clinical studies during 2020 will apply adaptive design to rapidly alter trial parameters across all study sites as results emerge.[43] Candidate vaccines may be added to the Solidarity trial as they become available if priority criteria are met, while vaccine candidates showing poor evidence of safety or efficacy compared to placebo or other vaccines will be dropped from the international trial.[43]
Adaptive designs within ongoing Phase II-III clinical trials on candidate vaccines may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early termination or success, avoiding duplication of research efforts, and enhancing coordination of design changes for the Solidarity trial across its international locations.[43][44]
Large pharmaceutical companies with experience in making vaccines at scale, including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), are forming alliances with biotechnology companies, national governments, and universities to accelerate progression to an effective vaccine.[15][18] To combine financial and manufacturing capabilities for a pandemic adjuvant technology, GSK joined with Sanofi in an uncommon partnership of multinational companies to support accelerated vaccine development.[46]
Geopolitical issues, safety concerns for vulnerable populations, and manufacturing challenges for producing billions of doses are compressing schedules to shorten the standard vaccine development timeline, in some cases combining clinical trial steps over months, a process typically conducted sequentially over years.[15] As an example, Chinese vaccine developers and the government Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention began their efforts in January 2020,[48] and by March were pursuing numerous candidates on short timelines, with the goal to showcase Chinese technology strengths over those of the United States, and to reassure the Chinese people about the quality of vaccines produced in China.[15][49]
(205 from combined sources[7][8][9])
As the pandemic expands during 2020, research at universities is obstructed by physical distancing and closing of laboratories.[52][53] Globally, supplies critical to vaccine research and development are increasingly scarce due to international competition or national sequestration.[29] Timelines for conducting clinical research – normally a sequential process requiring years – are being compressed into safety, efficacy, and dosing trials running simultaneously over months, potentially compromising safety assurance.[15][18]
CEPI classifies development stages for vaccines as either "exploratory" (planning and designing a candidate, having no evaluation in vivo), "preclinical" (in vivo evaluation with preparation for manufacturing a compound to test in humans), or initiation of Phase I safety studies in healthy people.[4]
Some 205 total vaccine candidates are in early stages of development as either confirmed active projects or in "exploratory" or "preclinical" development, as of mid-July.[8][9]
Phase I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in a few dozen healthy subjects, while Phase II trials – following success in Phase I – evaluate immunogenicity, dose levels (efficacy based on biomarkers) and adverse effects of the candidate vaccine, typically in hundreds of people.[54][55] A Phase I–II trial consists of preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses.[55] Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease (an "interventional" trial), while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.[54][55]
Phase II-III research is shown in orange; Phase II is in green; Phase I-II is in yellow.

By July, one organization reported that 205 vaccine candidates were in development as either "exploratory/preclinical" projects or in Phase I-III trials in human participants.[8] The table in this section lists emerging vaccine candidates whose Phase I trial starts are scheduled in 2020.
Commitment to first-in-human testing of a vaccine candidate represents a substantial capital cost for vaccine developers, estimated to be from US$14 million to US$25 million for a typical Phase I trial program, but possibly as much as US$70 million.[95][97] For comparison, during the Ebola virus epidemic of 2013-16, there were 37 vaccine candidates in urgent development, but only one eventually succeeded as a licensed vaccine, involving a total cost to confirm efficacy in Phase II–III trials of about US$1 billion.[95]
Vaccine failures result from various factors.[121] Inadequacies of the vaccine itself can occur from incomplete technology efficacy (less than 60% efficacy results in failure to create herd immunity),[14] ineffective vaccination route of administration (muscle vs. skin, oral, or nasal), or failed cold chain distribution or storage.[121] Host-("vaccinee")-related determinants that render a person susceptible to infection, such as genetics, health status (underlying disease, nutrition, pregnancy, sensitivities or allergies), immune competence, age, and economic or cultural environment can be primary or secondary factors affecting the severity of infection and response to a vaccine.[121] Elderly (above age 60), allergen-hypersensitive, and obese people have susceptibility to compromised immunogenicity, which prevents or inhibits vaccine effectiveness, possibly requiring separate vaccine technologies for these specific populations or repetitive booster vaccinations to limit virus transmission.[121]
An effective vaccine for coronavirus could save trillions of dollars in global economic impact, according to one expert, and would therefore make any price tag in the billions look small in comparison.[129] It is not yet known if it is even scientifically possible to create a vaccine for this virus, and it is not yet known exactly how much the vaccine development will cost.[11] It is possible that billions of dollars could be invested without success.[14][15][18]
The European Commission organized and held a video conference of world leaders on 4 May 2020, at which US$8 billion was raised for coronavirus vaccine development.[130]
After a vaccine is created, billions of doses will need to be manufactured and distributed worldwide. In April 2020, the Gates Foundation estimated that manufacturing and distribution could cost as much as US$25 billion.[131]
In early June, AstraZeneca made deals with CEPI and GAVI to manufacture up to two billion vaccine doses if its Oxford vaccine candidate proves safe and effective.[141] Commercialization of pandemic vaccines is a high-risk business venture, potentially losing billions of dollars in development and pre-market manufacturing costs if the candidate vaccines fail to be safe and effective.[11][15][18][138] The multinational pharmaceutical company, Pfizer, indicated it was not interested in a government partnership, which would be a "third party" slowing progress in Pfizer's vaccine program.[142] Further, there are concerns that rapid-development programs – like the Operation Warp Speed plan of the United States – are choosing vaccine candidates mainly for their manufacturing advantages to shorten the development timeline, rather than for the most promising vaccine technology having safety and efficacy.[142]
In June, the Serum Institute of India – a major manufacturer of global vaccines – received an advance order from AstraZeneca for 100 million vaccine doses, and indicated that doses manufactured in India may go first to Indian citizens, as required by the Indian government.[146][147] Similar preferential homeland distribution may exist if a vaccine is manufactured in Australia.[148] Amid concerns that vaccines produced in China would be distributed there first, the Chinese government pledged in May that a successful Chinese vaccine would become a "global, public good," inferring enough doses would be manufactured for both national and global distribution.[149]
Vaccines have been produced against several animal diseases caused by coronaviruses, including infectious bronchitis virus in birds, canine coronavirus, and feline coronavirus.[154]
Previous projects to develop vaccines for viruses in the family Coronaviridae that affect humans have been aimed at severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Vaccines against SARS[155] and MERS[156] have been tested in non-human animal models.
For SARS, as of 2020 there is no cure or protective vaccine that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.[157][158] According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world at that time.[159][160][161]
There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.[162] When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.[157][163] As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine which completed Phase I clinical trials in humans,[164] and three others in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines: two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).[165]
On 21 May 2020, the FDA made public the cease-and-desist notice it had sent to North Coast Biologics, a Seattle-based company that had been selling a purported "nCoV19 spike protein vaccine".[168]
The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Indian state of Maharashtra was confirmed on 9 March 2020.
Maharashtra is a hotspot that accounts for nearly one-third of the total cases in India as well as about 40% of all deaths.[1][2] As of 7 July, the state's case fatality rate is nearly 4.3%, which is lower than the global average but significantly higher than other Indian states with large numbers of cases.[3] Mumbai is the worst-affected city in India, with about 100,000 cases.[4] About half of the cases in the state emerged from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).

Declaration of epidemic in five cities;
On 13 March, the Government of Maharashtra declared the outbreak an epidemic in the cities of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune (PMC & PCMC limits) and Nagpur, and invoked provisions of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 which enabled it to forcibly hospitalise anyone with suspected symptoms. Commercial establishments such as movie halls, malls, swimming pools and gyms were shut across the state as a precaution.[77][78] Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray, issued a ban on all public gatherings and functions.[79] Pune Municipal Corporation decided to close all public gardens and Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park, effective from 14 March, to contain the spread of the virus.[80]
On 17 March, Section 144 was imposed in Nagpur and Nashik.[81]
On 18 March, the Federation of Trade Association of Pune announced that all shops, barring grocery stores and pharmacies, will be shut in the city, resulting in the closure of up to 40,000 shops.[82] Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced that shops and commercial establishments across several wards in Mumbai would be closed on alternate days, in order to implement social distancing and crowd management.[83] On 19 March, the dabbawalas in Mumbai suspended their services until 31 March.[84]
On 20 March, Thackeray announced that all workplaces, excluding essential services and public transport, in Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur will be closed until 31 March. He also urged people of the state to not step out of the house without the necessity of doing so.[85]
On 22 March, Thackeray declared that Section 144 would be imposed across the state, with effect from 23 March, sending the state into lockdown.[86] On 23 March, he announced that borders of all the districts will be closed, and a strict curfew will be implemented statewide.[87]
On 11 April, Thackeray announced that the lockdown in the state will be extended until "at least 30 April".[88] On 14 April, he announced the formation of a COVID-19 Task Force, comprising leading doctors, to advise the state government on means to control the outbreak.[62]
On 17 April, state government decided to relax lockdown restrictions, allowing certain economic activities such as agriculture, construction and manufacturing to resume from 20 April in non-containment zones.[89] However, on 21 April, as the number of cases continued to surge, the government withdrew the relaxation in MMR and Pune.[90]
On 26 March, BMC started marking pitches, one metre away from each other, outside grocery stores, fruits and vegetables shops in the city, in order to maintain social distancing. This model was first implemented in Pune on 24 March.[91]
From 1 April, Mumbai Police started using a network of 5,000 CCTV cameras along with drones in order to monitor different parts of the city and ensure that the lockdown is observed.[92] Apart from Mumbai, drones were also used in densely-populated areas of Thane district such as Mumbra and Bhiwandi for aerial surveillance and relaying audio messages and warnings.[93]
On 8 April, Mumbai became the first Indian city to make wearing facemasks in public places compulsory.[94] On the following day, the state government decided to deploy State Reserve Police Force in the city for stricter enforcement of the lockdown.[95]
On 31st May, the Maharashtra Government issued detailed guidelines for offices, which include mandatory thermal screening, use of sanitisers and social distancing[96].
In June, the cases in Dharavi, Mumbai dropped significantly because of preventive measures like testing and early isolation[97].
Nagpur Municipal Corporation has adopted an Incident Response System which includes a comprehensive survey, contact tracing system, corona war room, control room[98]. The corporation also conducted door-to-door surveys covering 5.67 lakh houses and 24 lakh people[98]. The civic body has also started shifting homeless people to city shelters[99]. As of March 27, they have shifted 300 persons and also got medical check-ups done for them[99].
Several places in the state, where multiple confirmed cases were reported, were sealed off to prevent community spread. These areas included Islampur in Sangli (on 28 March),[100] Worli Kolivada in Mumbai (on 30 March),[101] Peth area and parts of Kondhwa in Pune (on 6 April).[102] By 9 April, BMC identified 381 containment zones within the city; several parts of the city including Dharavi were sealed off as the number of confirmed cases rose sharply in April.[103]
The central government classified the country's districts into zones based on the extent of the spread of virus, with 14 districts in Maharashtra being identified as hotspots and labelled as red zones.[104] The state government announced that it would relax the lockdown restrictions in districts with fewer than 15 confirmed cases.[105]
Thackeray announced that the number of testing labs and their capacities would be increased, as will the capacity of quarantine facilities.[106] Some educational institutions are also being used as quarantine centres.[107]
Maharashtra government canceled all the exams from grades 1–8 to make it easier to contain the Coronavirus outbreak among school students. The students of grades 1 to 8 were directly promoted.[109] Mumbai university canceled the examinations of its first and second-year students respectively[110] and the education minister of Maharashtra wrote a letter to the university to cancel the examinations of its third-year students.[111]
On 22 March, the Indian Railways announced that the Mumbai Suburban Railway will be closed between 22 and 31 March. Mumbai Monorail and Mumbai Metro services were also cancelled until the end of the month. Thackeray announced that state-run and private bus services will be suspended for the general public until further notice.[86][116]
Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), the state’s biggest passenger transporter is diversifying 310 public transportation buses into goods transportation buses in Nagpur, because of depleting revenue due to the lockdown. The target is to convert 3,000 buses.[117]
Tourist spots in the state like Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Aurangabad district, Elephanta Island in Raigad district and Gateway of India in Mumbai reportedly witnessed a sharp decline in the number of visitors.[118] Hotel, cab and private bus businesses in the state also reported a high number of booking cancellations in March.[119]
Amidst a surge in confirmed cases across the state, the health officials declared that several tourist and religious sites will be closed down as a precautionary measure. These sites included Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, Tulja Bhavani Temple in Osmanabad district, Ajanta and Ellora Caves in Aurangabad district, Dagadusheth Halwai Ganapati Temple in Pune, Mumba Devi Temple in Mumbai and Saibaba Temple in Shirdi. Entry restrictions were also enforced at Mantralaya, Mumbai.[120][121] Mumbai Police placed a ban on all group tours in the city until 31 March.[122]
The virus outbreak had a significant impact on the automobile sector in the state, according to a CNBC TV18 article on 21 March. Bajaj Auto closed down its manufacturing facilities in Akurdi and Chakan until 30 March, while Tata Motors scaled down operations in its Pune plant. Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland shut down components plant in Thane and Bhandara respectively. Mercedes-Benz suspended operations at its Chakan facility until 31 March.[123] Fiat, Force Motors and JCB also announced suspension of operations at units in Ranjangaon, Akurdi and Chakan respectively, until 31 March.[124] Mahindra & Mahindra also declared that it would suspend manufacturing at its Nashik plant and production at its Chakan and Kandivali units, starting from 23 March.[125]
On 30 March, the state government slashed electricity tariff by an average of 8 percent for a period of five years in order to minimize the economic impact of the outbreak on industries.[129] Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister, Ajit Pawar, announced that the March salaries of all elected representatives (MLAs, MLCs and Chief Minister) would be cut by 60 percent, while some of the government employees will also see 25 to 50 percent salary cuts due to the economic crisis arising from outbreak and lockdown.[130]
According to the Maharashtra government, 60,000 industries have been re-opened in the state, which employ close to 1.5 million people.[131] The government also states that there have been investment intentions (FDI) from countries such as Germany, Japan, Russia.[131]
On 14 April, thousands of migrant workers protested against the lockdown near Bandra railway station in Mumbai, and demanded to be sent back to their states. Police made use of baton charges to disperse the unruly crowd and control the situation.[139]
By 1 May, authorities reported that 11.86 lakh migrant workers had been taken back to their home state by at least 822 Shramik special trains.[140]
After many suspected patients fled from isolation wards of hospitals, the state government directed officials at hospitals and airports to stamp the left hand of people placed under 14-day home quarantine with details of their quarantine period using indelible ink, so as to easily identify them. It also announced that those who violate the quarantine will be isolated at a government facility.[141]
Until mid-March, the state had three testing facilities, which also tested samples from some other states for confirmation, viz. National Institute of Virology in Pune, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital in Nagpur and Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai.[143]
As of 19 June 2020, the state had 61 government labs and 43 private labs approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research set up across the state.[144][145]
As of 10 April, Maharashtra has tested the most samples by any state in the country. Experts attribute the high number of positive cases in the state to "increased testing and surveillance" being done by the state authorities.[58]

Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.[5][6] They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.[7] The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.[8] They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.[9]
Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).[14] Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn described in 1931 a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness. The chicks' mortality rate was 40–90%.[15] Fred Beaudette and Charles Hudson six years later successfully isolated and cultivated the infectious bronchitis virus which caused the disease.[16] In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated.[17] It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related.[18]
Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s.[19][20] They were isolated using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States.[21] E.C. Kendall, Malcom Byone, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council in 1960 isolated from a boy a novel common cold virus B814.[22][23][24] The virus was not able to be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell and Byone successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea.[25] The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn.[26] The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope.[22][27] Around the same time, Dorothy Hamre[28] and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold virus 229E from medical students, which they grew in kidney tissue culture. The novel virus 229E, like the virus strain B814, when inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether.[29]
The two novel strains B814 and 229E were subsequently imaged by electron microscopy in 1967 by Scottish virologist June Almeida at St. Thomas Hospital in London.[30][31] Almeida through electron microscopy was able to show that B814 and 229E were morphologically related by their distinctive club-like spikes. Not only were they related with each other, but they were morphologically related to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).[32] A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named the virus strain OC43 (OC for organ culture).[33] Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.[34][35]
The IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus.[17] This new group of IBV-like viruses came to be known as coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance.[9] Human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades.[36][37] The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present human coronavirus it was.[38] Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HCoV HKU1 in 2005, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.[39][40] There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.[5]
The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer, in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored.[44] The ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300.[45] On average a coronavirus particle has 74 surface spikes.[46] A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).[5]
The coronavirus surface spikes are homotrimers of the S protein, which is composed of an S1 and S2 subunit. The homotrimeric S protein is a class I fusion protein which mediates the receptor binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. The S1 subunit forms the head of the spike and has the receptor binding domain (RBD). The S2 subunit forms the stem which anchors the spike in the viral envelope and on protease activation enables fusion. The E and M protein are important in forming the viral envelope and maintaining its structural shape.[43]
Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type conformation.[43][47] The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.[48]
The later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid.[49] Interspersed between these reading frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins. The number of accessory proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus.[43]
Infection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor. After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein. Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelop with the host membrane.[50]
The larger polyprotein pp1ab is a result of a -1 ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot at the end of open reading frame ORF1a.[51] The ribosomal frameshift allows for the continuous translation of ORF1a followed by ORF1b.[43]
The polyproteins have their own proteases, PLpro (nsp3) and 3CLpro (nsp5), which cleave the polyproteins at different specific sites. The cleavage of polyprotein pp1ab yields 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). Product proteins include various replication proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), RNA helicase (nsp13), and exoribonuclease (nsp14).[43]
A number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex. The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand. The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process. The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks.[52]
Replication – One of the main functions of the complex is to replicate the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense genomic RNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This is followed by the replication of positive-sense genomic RNA from the negative-sense genomic RNA.[43]
Transcription – The other important function of the complex is to transcribe the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This process is followed by the transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mRNAs.[43] The subgenomic mRNAs form a "nested set" which have a common 5'-head and partially duplicate 3'-end.[53]
Recombination – The replicase-transcriptase complex is also capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same infected cell.[53] RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within a coronavirus species, the capability of a coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and, infrequently, in determining the emergence of novel coronaviruses.[54] The exact mechanism of recombination in coronaviruses is unclear, but likely involves template switching during genome replication.[54]
The replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses. The mRNAs are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame. These mRNAs are translated by the host's ribosomes into the structural proteins and a number of accessory proteins.[43] RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum. The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment. There, the M proteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid. Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles. Once released the viruses can infect other host cells.[55]
Infected carriers are able to shed viruses into the environment. The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complementary cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the released virus.[56][57] Coronaviruses mainly target epithelial cells.[5] They are transmitted from one host to another host, depending on the coronavirus species, by either an aerosol, fomite, or fecal-oral route.[58]
Human coronaviruses infect the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, while animal coronaviruses generally infect the epithelial cells of the digestive tract.[5] SARS coronavirus, for example, infects via an aerosol route,[59] the human epithelial cells of the lungs by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.[60] Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) infects, via a fecal-oral route,[58] the pig epithelial cells of the digestive tract by binding to the alanine aminopeptidase (APN) receptor.[43]
The scientific name for coronavirus is Orthocoronavirinae or Coronavirinae.[2][3][4] Coronaviruses belong to the family of Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.[5][6] They are divided into alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses which infect mammals – and gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses, which primarily infect birds.[61][62]
The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species.[63] The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and of the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE. Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus – and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses). The large number and global range of bat and avian species that host viruses has enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.[64]
Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats.[65] The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 CE.[66] The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 CE.[67] More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960.[68] MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels.[69] MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago.[70] The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986.[71] A possible path of evolution of SARS coronavirus and keen bat coronaviruses is that SARS-related coronaviruses coevolved in bats for a long time. The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats of the genus Hipposideridae; subsequently, they spread to horseshoe bats in the species Rhinolophidae, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans.[72][73]
Unlike other betacoronaviruses, bovine coronavirus of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and subgenus Embecovirus is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats.[65][74] In the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump.[75] Later in the 1890s, human coronavirus OC43 diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event.[76][75] It is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, and unknown causative agent of the pandemic.[77] Besides causing respiratory infections, human coronavirus OC43 is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases.[78] In the 1950s, the human coronavirus OC43 began to diverge into its present genotypes.[79] Phylogentically, mouse hepatitis virus (Murine coronavirus), which infects the mouse's liver and central nervous system,[80] is related to human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus. Human coronavirus HKU1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.[65]
Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold.[43] Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids.[81] Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).[82] The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.[82]
Six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.
Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild:
Three human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are potentially severe:
The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold in adults and children worldwide.[83] These coronaviruses cause about 15% of common colds,[84] while 40 to 50% of colds are caused by rhinoviruses.[85] The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates.[86][87] There is no preponderance in any season in tropical climates.[88]
In 2003, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which had begun the prior year in Asia, and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by a number of laboratories was the causative agent for SARS. The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). More than 8,000 people were infected, about ten percent of whom died.[60]
In September 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called Novel Coronavirus 2012, and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).[98][99] The World Health Organization issued a global alert soon after.[100] The WHO update on 28 September 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person.[101] However, on 12 May 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in France was confirmed by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.[102] In addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the Ministry of Health in Tunisia. Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Despite this, it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus.[103] By 30 October 2013, there were 124 cases and 52 deaths in Saudi Arabia.[104]
After the Dutch Erasmus Medical Centre sequenced the virus, the virus was given a new name, Human Coronavirus—Erasmus Medical Centre (HCoV-EMC). The final name for the virus is Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The only U.S. cases (both survived) were recorded in May 2014.[105]
In May 2015, an outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in the Republic of Korea, when a man who had traveled to the Middle East, visited four hospitals in the Seoul area to treat his illness. This caused one of the largest outbreaks of MERS-CoV outside the Middle East.[106] As of December 2019, 2,468 cases of MERS-CoV infection had been confirmed by laboratory tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately 34.5%.[107]
In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China.[108] On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus,[109] which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO),[110][111][112] later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
As of 17 July 2020, there have been at least 592,573[94] confirmed deaths and more than 13,885,746[94] confirmed cases in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group 2B with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV.[113] The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.[114][115] The pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and nationwide lockdowns in many countries.
Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s.[17] They infect a range of animals including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds and bats.[116] The majority of animal related coronaviruses infect the intestinal tract and are transmitted by a fecal-oral route.[117] Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases.[118]
Coronaviruses infect domesticated birds.[119] Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a type of coronavirus, causes avian infectious bronchitis.[120] The virus is of concern to the poultry industry because of the high mortality from infection, its rapid spread, and its effect on production.[116] The virus affects both meat production and egg production and causes substantial economic loss.[121] In chickens, infectious bronchitis virus targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract. The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken.[120] The virus is transmitted by aersol and food contaminated by feces. Different vaccines against IBV exist and have helped to limit the spread of the virus and its variants.[116] Infectious bronchitis virus is one of a number of strains of the species Avian coronavirus.[122] Another strain of avian coronavirus is turkey coronavirus (TCV) which causes enteritis in turkeys.[116]
Coronaviruses also affect other branches of animal husbandry such as pig farming and the cattle raising.[116] Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which is related to bat coronavirus HKU2, causes diarrhea in pigs.[123] Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that has recently emerged and similarly causes diarrhea in pigs.[124] Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is a member of the species Alphacoronavirus 1,[125] is another coronavirus that causes diarrhea in young pigs.[126][127] In the cattle industry bovine coronavirus (BCV), which is a member of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and related to HCoV-OC43,[128] is responsible for severe profuse enteritis in young calves.[116]
Coronaviruses infect domestic pets such as cats, dogs, and ferrets.[119] There are two forms of feline coronavirus which are both members of the species Alphacoronavirus 1.[125] Feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease with high mortality.[116] There are two different coronaviruses that infect dogs. Canine coronavirus (CCoV), which is a member of the species Alphacoronavirus 1,[125] causes mild gastrointestinal disease.[116] Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), which is a member of the species Betacoronavirus 1 and related to HCoV-OC43,[128] cause respiratory disease.[116] Similarly, there are two types of coronavirus that infect ferrets.[129] Ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE), and a more lethal systemic version of the virus (like FIP in cats) known as ferret systemic coronavirus (FSC).[130][131]
Coronaviruses infect laboratory animals.[116] Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which is a member of the species Murine coronavirus,[132] causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice.[133] Prior to the discovery of SARS-CoV, MHV was the best-studied coronavirus both in vivo and in vitro as well as at the molecular level. Some strains of MHV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis.[118] Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), which is a strain of the species Murine coronavirus,[132] is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol. Acute infections have high morbidity and tropism for the salivary, lachrymal and harderian glands.[134] Rabbit enteric coronavirus causes acute gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in young European rabbits.[116] Mortality rates are high.[135]
There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. Treatment is only supportive. A number of antivirial targets have been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication. A number of vaccines using different methods are also under development for different human coronaviruses.[43]
There are no antiviral drugs to treat animal coronaviruses.[citation needed] Vaccines are available for IBV, TGEV, and Canine CoV, although their effectiveness is limited. In the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, such as PEDV, measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other herds.[43]

This article provides a general overview and documents the status of locations affected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
As of 17:45 UTC on 17 July 2020, a total of 13,885,746 cases are confirmed in more than 227 countries and territories,[4] and 26 cruise and naval ships.[5] There are 5,513,569 active cases and 592,573 deaths.[4]
According to Michael Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, early detection is vital because the continent's health systems "are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks".[312][313] Advisers say that a strategy based on testing could allow African countries to minimise lockdowns that inflict enormous hardship on those who depend on income earned day by day to be able to feed themselves and their families. Even in the best scenario, the United Nations says 74 million test kits and 30,000 ventilators will be needed by the continent's 1.3 billion people in 2020.[314] Most of the reported cases are from six countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria, but it is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in other African countries with poorer health care systems.[315] Cases have been confirmed in all African countries, with Lesotho the last country to report its first coronavirus case on 13 May 2020.[316] There have been no reported cases in the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.[317]
As of 2 July, Antarctica is the only continent not yet reached by the COVID-19 pandemic.[318][319]
A cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan and eventually spread to the rest of China. Afterwards, many other Asian countries started to confirm cases, with some of the most affected countries being South Korea, Turkey and Iran. A number of countries such as India and Malaysia also experienced a surge in cases following religious gatherings. As of 30 April, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for North Korea and Turkmenistan, both of which have suspected cases. The lack of cases in North Korea is disputed, given its shared border with China, while concerns have been raised about the ability for its health system to cope.[319] There have been no reported cases in the Australian external territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.[321][322]
A small number of initial cases in Europe were reported in France, Germany and other countries. On 21 February, a large outbreak was reported in Italy, mostly in the north near Milan. Cases grew rapidly as the outbreak spread across Europe. Cases had been reported in all European countries when Montenegro reported a case on 17 March, and in almost all European territories after the Isle of Man on 19 March, the disputed state of Transnistria on 21 March,[323] and the Åland Islands on 22 March reported cases. No cases have been reported in the Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands.[319] The WHO declared Europe as the new epicenter of the virus after the situation improved in China.[324] On 26 May, the epicenter was declared by the WHO to have moved to the Americas.[325]
The first cases in North America were reported in the United States in January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on 16 April.[326]
On 26 March 2020, the U.S. became the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, with over 82,000 cases.[327] On 11 April 2020, the U.S. became the country with the highest official death toll for COVID-19, with over 20,000 deaths.[328] As of 15 June 2020 the total cases of COVID-19 were 3,483,905 with 138,358 total deaths.[329]
The first confirmed case was in Melbourne, Victoria on 25 January.[332] Many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their international borders. As of 17 July 2020,[333] no cases have been reported in the sovereign states of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.[319] No cases have been reported in the territories of American Samoa (territory of the United States), the Cook Islands (associated state of New Zealand), Niue (associated state of New Zealand), Norfolk Island (external territory of Australia), the Pitcairn Islands (British Overseas Territory), Tokelau (territory of New Zealand), and Wallis and Futuna (French overseas collectivity).
As of 15 July, 13,773 cases have been reported in Oceania; the five countries reporting the most cases are: Australia (10,495), New Zealand (1,547), Guam (313), French Polynesia (60), and Fiji (26). 162 deaths have been reported in the region: Australia (111), New Zealand (22), Guam (5), and the Northern Mariana Islands (2).[334]

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[9] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic.[10][11] The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei.[12] As of 17 July 2020, more than 13.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 592,000 deaths. More than 7.77 million people have recovered.[8]
Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.[13][5][6][14] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[15] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.[16][17][18] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[5][19]
The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, and talking.[6][20][22] The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.[6][23] Transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[24] Less commonly, people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face.[6][20] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.[6][20] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[25] Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, guidelines do not recommend using CT imaging for routine screening.[26][27]
Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[7][28][29] The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use.[30][31] Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should only be used by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.[32][33]
Fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19,[13] but is highly variable in severity and presentation, with some older, immunocompromised, or critically ill people not having fever at all.[39][40] In one study, only 44% of people had fever when they presented to the hospital, while 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.[41]
Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains.[13][1][5][42] Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.[43][44][45] Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and skin lesions.[46] Some cases in China initially presented with only chest tightness and palpitations.[47] A decreased sense of smell or disturbances in taste may occur.[48][49] Loss of smell was a presenting symptom in 30% of confirmed cases in South Korea.[14][50]
An early key to the diagnosis is the tempo of the illness. Early symptoms may include a wide variety of symptoms but infrequently involves shortness of breath. Shortness of breath usually develops several days after initial symptoms. Shortness of breath that begins immediately along with fever and cough is more likely to be anxiety than COVID-19. The most critical days of illness tend to be those following the development of shortness of breath.[55] A minority of cases do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[56] These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested, and their role in transmission is not fully known.[57][58] Preliminary evidence suggested they may contribute to the spread of the disease.[59] In June 2020, a spokeswoman of WHO said that asymptomatic transmission appears to be "rare," but the evidence for the claim was not released.[60] The next day, WHO clarified that they had intended a narrow definition of "asymptomatic" that did not include pre-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic (weak symptoms) transmission and that up to 41% of transmission may be asymptomatic. Transmission without symptoms does occur.[56]
Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[10][16][61][62] Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.[63]
A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that "the risk for severe COVID-19 was 45% higher for people with type A blood than those with other blood types."[64][65]
Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[68] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[69][70]
People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).[22] They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.[22] People can also transmit the virus without showing any symptom (asymptomatic transmission), but it is unclear how often this happens.[6][20][22] A June 2020 review found that 40–45% of infected people are asymptomatic.[71]
COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.[22][72] The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance;[6] the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 metres (6 ft).[20] Transmission may also occur through aerosols, smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[24] Some medical procedures performed on COVID-19 patients in health facilities can generate those smaller droplets. Some outbreaks have also been reported in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor locations where infected persons spend long periods of time (such as restaurants and nightclubs).[73] Aerosol transmission in such locations has not been ruled out.[24]
The virus may occur in breast milk, but it's unknown whether it's infectious and transmittable to the baby.[83][84]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.[85] All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.[86] Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[26]
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[87] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).[46] In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in the binding domain of the S protein between the coronaviruses from pangolins and those from humans; however, whole-genome comparison to date[when?] found that at most 92% of genetic material was shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.[88]
SARS-CoV-2 may also cause respiratory failure through affecting the brainstem as other coronaviruses have been found to invade the central nervous system (CNS). While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain.[94][95][unreliable medical source?]
The virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[96] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[97][unreliable medical source?]
Another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[103][better source needed] Early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalized patients in both China and New York have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[104]
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[108] The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).[109] The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[25][110] Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.[111][112] Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart, and the results have little immediate value.[113] Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.[10][114][115] As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.[116][117][118] Antibody tests may be most accurate 2–3 weeks after a person's symptoms start.[119] The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.[120] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.[121] The absence or presence of COVID-19 signs and symptoms alone is not reliable enough for an accurate diagnosis.[122]
Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count.[123]
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[139][140][141][142]
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[143][30][144] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[30][145] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[30][145] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[146][147][148][149]
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[150] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[140] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[140]
Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.[151] Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.[152] After the implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many regions have been able to sustain an effective transmission rate ("Rt") of less than one, meaning the disease is in remission in those areas.[153]
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing. The CDC further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.[140] For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production. In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis". Glycerol is added as a humectant.[154]
Sanitizing of frequently touched surfaces is also recommended or required by regulation for businesses and public facilities; the United States Environmental Protection Agency maintains a list of products expected to be effective.[156]
On 7 July 2020, the WHO said in a press conference that it will issue new guidelines about airborne transmission in settings with close contact and poor ventilation.[157]
For health care professionals who may come into contact with COVID-19 positive bodily fluids, using personal protective coverings on exposed body parts improves protection from the virus.[158] Breathable personal protective equipment improves user-satisfaction and may offer a similar level of protection from the virus.[158] In addition, adding tabs and other modifications to the protective equipment may reduce the risk of contamination during donning and doffing (putting on and taking off the equipment).[158] Implementing an evidence-based donning and doffing protocol such as a one-step glove and gown removal technique, giving oral instructions while donning and doffing, double gloving, and the use of glove disinfection may also improve protection for health care professionals.[158]
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.[159][160][161] The CDC recommends those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.[32] Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[citation needed][162] Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.[163] Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.[164]
Some studies have found that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be helpful in early screening for severe illness.[228]
The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.[234] Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.[235] This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.[236]
There are several theories about where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[247] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year old citizen in the Hubei province. There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were "patient zero".[12] By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[170][248] The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[249] and at least 266 by 31 December.[250] On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[251] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[252] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[253] Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January),[254] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[255]
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases[256][257][258]—enough to trigger an investigation.[259]
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[260] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[261] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[262] Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[263] and more may have been infected.[264] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".[265][266] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.[264] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[267]
On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[268] As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[269] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths.[270] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[271] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[272] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[273][274] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[275]
On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case,[276] Beijing reported the first COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[277] By 15 June, 79 cases were officially confirmed.[278] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[276][279]
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[280] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.[281]
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.3% (592,573/13,885,746) as of 17 July 2020.[8] The number varies by region.[282]
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.[283]
Infection fatality rate (or infection fatality ratio) is distinguished from case fatality rate. The case fatality rate ("CFR") for a disease is the proportion of deaths from the disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease (within a certain period of time). The infection fatality ratio ("IFR"), in contrast, is the proportion of deaths among all the infected individuals. IFR, unlike CFR, attempts to account for all asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections.
Our World in Data states that, as of 25 March 2020, the infection fatality rate (IFR) for coronavirus cannot be accurately calculated.[288] In February, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.33% and 1%.[289][290] On 2 July, The WHO's Chief Scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.[291][292]
The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0.4% (0.2% to 1%) and that 35% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.26% (as of 20 May).[293][294] The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May).[295] According to CEBM, random antibody testing in Germany suggested a national IFR of 0.37% (0.12% to 0.87%).[295][296][297] To get a better view on the number of people infected, as of April 2020, initial antibody testing had been carried out, but peer-reviewed scientific analyses had not yet been published.[298][299] On 1 May antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of 0.86%.[300]
Firm lower limits of infection fatality rates have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,266 individuals (18,652 confirmed and 4,614 probable) have died with COVID-19 (0.28% of the population).[301] In Bergamo province, 0.57% of the population has died.[302]
Early reviews of epidemiologic data showed greater impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in China and Italy.[303][1][304] The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.[305] Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[306][307] One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[308]
In the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans.[309] Structural factors that prevent African Americans from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in "essential" occupations such as public transit and health care. Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care and of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease also increase their risk of death.[310] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities.[309] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.[311] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.[312] Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[313]
In the U.K., a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred in those of a Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority background.[314][315][316] Several factors such as poverty, poor nutrition and living in overcrowded properties, may have caused this.[citation needed]
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",[317][318][319] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[320][321] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,[322] Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.[323]
In January 2020, the World Health Organisation recommended 2019-nCov[324] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[325] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma.[326][327][328]
The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38% fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40% fewer in Spain.[334] The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital."[335] There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment.[335] Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions.[336] In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, attributable to COVID-19 quarantines and social distancing measures.[337][338] Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic.[339][340][341] The pandemic has also negatively impacted mental health globally, including increased loneliness resulting from social distancing.[342]
A study on domesticated animals inoculated with the virus found that cats and ferrets appear to be "highly susceptible" to the disease, while dogs appear to be less susceptible, with lower levels of viral replication. The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.[346]
In March 2020, researchers from the University of Hong Kong have shown that Syrian hamsters could be a model organism for COVID-19 research.[347]
There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand. To minimise the harm from misinformation, medical professionals and the public are advised to expect rapid changes to available information, and to be attentive to retractions and other updates.[354]
Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.[360]
In June, initial results from a randomised trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for patients who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.[374] Because this is a well tested and widely available treatment this was welcomed by the WHO that is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids.[375][376] Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the National Institutes of Health for patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.[377]
The Feinstein Institute of Northwell Health announced in March a study on "a human antibody that may prevent the activity" of IL-6.[389]
The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia,[8] and has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States and Brazil[9] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May, 200,000 on 3 June, [10][11] and 1,000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020.
India's case fatality rate is relatively lower at 2.80%, against the global 4.7%, as of 6 July.[12] Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country – Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[13] As of 24 May 2020, Lakshadweep is the only region which has not reported a case. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time reducing 49% of total infections[14] followed by recovery rate crossing 60% till early July. Although, active have continued to increase persistently.
On 22 March, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi. It was followed by mandatory lockdowns in COVID-19 hotspots and all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the Prime Minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India. On 14 April, the PM extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May which was followed by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17 May with substantial relaxations. From 1 June, the Government has started "unlocking" the country (barring "containment zones") in three unlock phases.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21]
The United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have praised India's response to the pandemic as 'Comprehensive and robust,' terming the Lockdown restrictions as aggressive but vital for containing the spread and building necessary healthcare infrastructure. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) noted the government's swift and stringent actions, emergency policy making, emergency investment in healthcare, fiscal stimulus, investment in vaccine and drug R&D. It gave India a score of 100 for its strict response. Michael Ryan, chief executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme noted that India had tremendous capacity to deal with the outbreak owing to its vast experience in eradicating smallpox and polio.[22][23][24] In June, India was ranked 56th of 200 countries in COVID 19 safety assessment report by Deep Knowledge Group.[25] Though, other commentators have also raised concerns about the economic fallout arising as a result of the pandemic and preventive restrictions.[26][27] The lockdown was justified by the government and other agencies for being preemptive to prevent India from entering a higher stage which could make handling very difficult and cause even more losses thereafter.[28][29]
On 12 January 2020, the WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[30][31]
Jan 30 Jan 30 Feb 2–21 Feb 2–21 Mar 2–31 Mar 2–31 Apr 1–30 Apr 1–30 May 1–31 May 1–31 Jun 1–26 Jun 1–26 Last 21 days Last 21 days
On 30 January, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Kerala, which rose to three cases by 3 February; all were students returning from Wuhan. Apart from these, no significant rise in transmissions was observed in February. On 4 March 22 new cases were reported, including 14 infected members of an Italian tourist group.[38][39]
In March, the transmissions grew after several people with travel history to affected countries, and their contacts, tested positive. On 12 March, a 76-year-old man, with a travel history to Saudi Arabia, became the first COVID-19 fatality of India.[40]
A Sikh preacher, who had a travel history to Italy and Germany, turned into a "super spreader" by attending a Sikh festival in Anandpur Sahib during 10–12 March.[41][42] Twenty-seven COVID-19 cases were traced back to him.[43] Over 40,000 people in 20 villages in Punjab were quarantined on 27 March to contain the spread.[42][44]
On 31 March, a Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation event in Delhi, which had taken place earlier in March, emerged as a new virus super spreader event, after numerous cases across the country were traced back to it. On 18 April, the Health ministry announced that 4,291 cases were directly linked to the event.[45][46]
On 2 May, in Punjab, around 4,000 stranded pilgrims returned from Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra. Many of them tested positive, including 27 bus drivers and conductors who had been part of the transport arrangement. Till 13 May, 1,225 pilgrims had been tested positive.[47][48][49]
The outbreak has been declared an epidemic in more than a dozen states and union territories, where provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 have been invoked, leading to the temporary closure of educational and commercial establishments. All tourist visas have been suspended, as a majority of the confirmed cases were mainly imports.[50]
Protective measures were first applied in January. India began thermal screening of passengers arriving from China on 21 January.[51] Initially carried out at seven airports, it was expanded to 20 airports towards the end of January.[52] During February, the screening was extended to passengers from Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea.[53] Nepal, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia were added to the list towards the end of February.[54] Very few new cases were discovered during February, The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) admitted that airport screening alone was insufficient.[55]
By early to mid-March, the government had drawn up plans to deal with a worsening of the pandemic in the country. This included seven ministries working together to set up additional quarantine and treatment facilities across the country. States and twenty ministries, including Home, Defence, Railways, Labour, Minority Affairs, Aviation and Tourism, were informed of the containment plan.[56] Plans to avoid a panic-like situation were also made.

On 4 April, the Government of India banned the export of hydroxychloroquine "without any exception", to stockpile supplies for domestic use.[124] The United States, which imports half its supply of the drug from India and expects to use it for treating COVID-19 patients, grew concerned. The US President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Modi the next day, and hinted at possible retaliation in a press conference. India agreed to allow its export on "humanitarian grounds".[125] Apart from the US, India had outstanding orders for hydroxychloroquine from some 30 countries, including Brazil, Spain, France, UK, Germany, Australia, the Gulf countries and the SAARC neighbours. The decision to partially lift the ban preceded President Trump's comment on possible retaliation.[126]
On 11 April, India sent a team of 15 doctors and health care professionals to Kuwait to assist in its fight against coronavirus, following a telephone conversion between prime minister Modi and the Kuwaiti prime minister Sabah Al-Khalid Al-Sabah.

On 10 May the Indian government sent Naval ship INS Kesari, which carried medical teams, essential medicines and food items to the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles following separate requests for help in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.[130] [131]
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology launched a smart phone application called Aarogya Setu to help in "contact tracing and containing the spread" of COVID-19 pandemic in the nation. The World Bank lauded the early deployment of such technology to combat the pandemic. Amid growing privacy and security concerns, the government released the source code of the app, making it open-source on 26 May. The Government has promoted voluntary adoption of the app in its guidelines and standard operating procedures.[132][133][134]
The Union Health Ministry's war room and policy making team in New Delhi consists of the ministry's Emergency Medical Response Unit, the Central Surveillance Unit (IDSP), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and experts from three government hospitals.[138] They are part of policy decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the country.[138] A cluster-containment strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how India contained previous epidemics, as well as "breaking the chain of transmission".[138][139][140] 15 labs across India led by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, are testing for the virus, with more labs being trained, as of early March.[141] On 14 March 65 labs were named capable for testing for the virus (though as of 17 March not all are fully functional).[142][143][144]
On 14 March, scientists at the National Institute of Virology isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus. By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus after China, Japan, Thailand and the US.[145] The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that isolation of the virus will help towards expediting the development of drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country.[146] NIV has shared two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with GISAID.[147] On 16 April, China sent 650,000 testing kits to India[148] but their use was discontinued in view of a very low accuracy (of just 5.4%).[149] In May, National Institute of Virology introduced another antibody test kit ELISA for rapid testing, capable of processing 90 samples in a single run of 2.5 hours.[150]
Initially, the labs tested samples only from those with a travel history to 12 countries designated as high-risk, or those who have come in contact with anyone testing positive for the coronavirus, or showing symptoms as per the government guidelines.[151][152] On 20 March, the government decided to also include all pneumonia cases, regardless of travel or contact history after the country saw a sharp increase in the number of cases.[153] The first and second confirmatory tests for the virus has been made free by the government.[154] On 9 April, ICMR further revised the testing strategy and allowed testing of the people showing symptoms for a week in the hotspot areas of the country, regardless of travel history or local contact to a patient.[155]
The Ministry of Health said that only 10 per cent of test capacity had been used per day till 15 March,[154] claiming that the number of tests was enough. However experts thought they were not, saying that community transmission may go undetected without adequate testing.[143] They also wanted to add more testing centres by inclusion of private laboratories.[143][152] In mid-March the government authorised accredited private labs to test for the virus.[156]
On 17 March, the Union Ministry of Health had decided to allow private pathology labs to test for COVID-19. The ministry official claimed that by allowing private labs, the work of testing can be doubled. The ministry said that NABL accredited laboratories may soon be allowed.[157] Once set up, a person can get COVID-19 test done at a private lab after a qualified physician in a government facility recommends it.[158] The ICMR has appealed to the private labs to offer the tests for free as the government labs do.[157]
On 19 March, Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy stated that India could be facing a "tsunami of cases within a few weeks" as testing increases and the reason for the low number of confirmed cases currently is due to under-testing. He also said that according to mathematical models applied in the US or UK at least 20%–60% of the population will be affected. Applying the same models in India means that at the lower end of the estimate there could be 300 million cases of which 4–8 million could be severe.[162]
On 13 April, ICMR advised pool testing in the low infection areas with a positivity rate less than 2% to increase the capacity of the testing and save resources. In this process maximum five samples are tested at once and samples are tested individually only if a pool tests positive.[167] Andaman and Nicobar Islands[168] and Uttar Pradesh[169] have started doing pool testing.
On 14 April, ICMR and DGCI approved 18 new suppliers of test kits that included three Indian firms, bringing the total suppliers to 51.[170]
On 16 April, 650,000 rapid antibody test and RNA extraction kits were dispatched from China, and over 2 million kits were to be sent in next 15 days.[149] On 21 April, Health department of West Bengal alleged that large number of testing kits supplied by ICMR-NICED (National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases) were giving inconclusive results. ICMR-NICED admitted that there was problem in the kits and said that they are addressing the issue.[171] While Rajasthan stopped using rapid testing kits as they were giving low accuracy of 5.4% in compared to expected 90% accuracy.[172] Later, ICMR advised all states to stop using rapid testing kits for next two days until their on-ground teams validates these kits.[173] Rapid antibody test kits were put on hold till further notice. The Chinese manufactures of the rapid testing kits said that the testing kits were approved by ICMR and the problem is not with the kits but with the way they were being used. However, Chinese manufacturers promised to cooperate with Indian authorities to resolve the issue.[174][175] Amid this, ICMR asked states to return the faulty kits which will be sent back to the Chinese suppliers and cancelled the order of all remaining kits.[176][177]
Testing for community transmission began on 15 March. 65 laboratories of the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) have started testing random samples of people who exhibit flu-like symptoms and samples from patients without any travel history or contact with infected persons.[178][179] As of 18 March, no evidence of community transmission was found after results of 500 random samples tested negative.[180] Between 15 February and 2 April, 5,911 SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illnesses) patients were tested throughout the country of which, 104 tested positive (1.8%) in 20 states and union territories. About 40% of the identified patients did not have travel history or any history of contact with a positive patient.[181] The ICMR advised to prioritise containment in the 36 districts of 15 states which had reported positive cases among SARI patients.[182]
In Rajasthan, a combination of anti-malaria, anti-swine flu and anti-HIV drugs resulted in the recovery of three patients in March.[183] In the same month, the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Cipla launched a joint venture to develop anti-COVID-19 drugs.[184] Another Indian firm, Stempeutics, announced plans to introduce a stem cell-based agent for treating critical COVID-19 patients.[185] Following randomised clinical trials, another Indian firm Biocon got its novel biologic therapy by use of a newly formulated intravenous drug for treatment of patients.[186]
In March, a startup incubated in Pune's SciTech Park introduced 'Airon', a negative ion generator capable of reducing a room's viral load by 99.7%.[187] In April, funds for a number of preventive agents were released to initiate research.[188][189]
On 23 March, the National Task Force for COVID-19 constituted by the ICMR recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of high-risk cases.[190]
According to estimates, India has around 40,000 ventilators, of which 8,432 are with the public sector.[191] Various Indian PSUs, firms and startups, including DRDO and ISRO, have since repurposed their production lines to manufacture general PPEs, full body suits and ventilators. They are also designing low-cost or mobile medical equipment.[192][193][194][195] The focus was to increase the production of low-cost, compact and portable ventilators that could cater to multiple patients at a time. This led to the creation of some of the world's smallest and cheapest ventilators.[196] The government aims to double the current capacity of ventilators by June 2020 with the assistance from PSUs. The government has also requested major private automakers to explore the possibility of manufacturing ventilators at their plants.[197] Maruti Suzuki, in collaboration with AgVa Healthcare, will supply 10,000 ventilators till end of the May.[198] From nil in near past, India was producing around 200,000 PPE kits and 250,000 N95 masks per day in May 2020.[199] By second half of month, India had emerged as world's second largest producer of PPE body coveralls.[200]
The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology has been working on genome sequencing of COVID-19.[201] In May, CCMB also started a partnership with a private company Eyestem Research to grow novel coronavirus strain in human lung epithelial cells for research and trials of anti-viral drugs.[202]
On 12 April, the ICMR invited health institutions and hospitals to participate in trials of convalescent plasma therapy and plasma exchange therapy. Later, the ICMR submitted a list of such institutes to the DCGI to start trials,[203] which the DCGI approved.[204] Several states were allowed by ICMR to start clinical trials of the plasma therapy.[205][206] In Delhi, a 49-year-old man who was on ventilator support became the first patient in the country, who recovered through plasma therapy in April.[207] Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said that the initial results of the plasma therapy treatment on four patients gave positive and encouraging results, adding that they had decided to conduct it on three more patients.[208] However, the ICMR later stated that there is no robust evidence to support convalescent plasma therapy as a routine therapy, describing it is as an emerging and experimental therapy. It has some risks, which include life-threatening allergies and lung injuries. The ICMR have since started multi-centre clinical trials to ensure the treatment's safety and efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients across the country.[209]
Pune-based Serum Institute of India announced that it would apply for clinical trials of certain strains from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April. As per company president Adar Poonawalla, a vaccine for COVID-19 will be delivered within a year. However, it may not be effective on 20 to 30% people.[210] Two other companies are also trying to develop a vaccine: Zydus Cadila, which is replicating viral vector and developing a DNA plasmid vaccine,[211] and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with US based FluGen, which is expecting the first clinical trials of a nasal vaccine by late 2020.[212] As of late February, the Serum Institute of India had begun animal trials of vaccine candidates,[213] followed by Zydus Cadila in March.[214] ICMR partnered with Bharat Biotech in May to develop COVID vaccine completely in India.[215] Till May, there were over 30 candidates of COVID-19 vaccine in development in India, many of which were already in pre-clinical tests.[216] Four vaccines were expected to enter fully clinical trials in August–October.[217] Per reports emerged in July, ICMR was preparing to launch BBV152 COVID vaccine or Covaxin , India's first COVID-19 vaccine on 15 August following its ongoing human trials in July.[218] Although, later deadline was cited as only meant to cut "red tape" and expected timeline of any Indian vaccine not to be before 2021.[219] In mid-July, Zydus Cadila too had followed with human trials of its vaccine named ZyCoV-D.[220]

The Ministry of Textiles stated that India was producing no Personal Protective Equipment kits before the pandemic. By May 2020, it began producing an average of 150,000 PPE kits per day.[358]
The Nizamuddin faction of the Tablighi Jamaat held a religious congregational program (Ijtema) in Nizamuddin West, Delhi in March.[359][360][361] The Delhi Government's order against organising seminars, conferences or any big event (beyond 200 people) was apparently ignored by the organisation, and the Delhi Police also failed to enforce it.[362][363] The gathering emerged as one of India's major coronavirus hotspots.[364] The entire Nizamuddin West area was cordoned off by the police as of 30 March, and medical camps were set up.[365] On 18 April, the Central Government stated that 4,291 cases (or 29.8% of the total 14,378 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India) were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat, and these cases were spread across 23 states and Union Territories.[366] As of 4 April, about 22,000 people who came in contact with the Tablighi Jamaat missionaries had to be quarantined.[367]
Hyderabad witnessed panic buying throughout 20 and 21 March.[368] Panic buying of milk and other dairy products was also reported.[369][370] Online grocery delivery service Grofers also witnessed panic buying across states.[371]
Retailers and consumer goods firms saw their average daily sales more than double on 19 March as consumers rushed to buy essentials ahead of PM Narendra Modi's address to the nation.[372] In response to this, Modi assured the citizens that there was enough food and ration supplies and advised them against panic buying.[373]
Several cases are reported across the country, where people who are suspected to have come in contact with the virus, escaped from the quarantines and hospitals.[374][375]

On 13 March in Telangana, one woman returned from Singapore has been missing, while a man who came from Doha went somewhere without telling hospital staff.[380]
Despite evidence to the contrary, a viral rumour spread online alleging that only people who eat meat were affected by coronavirus, causing "#NoMeat_NoCoronaVirus" to trend on Twitter.[381] To curb these rumours and combat declining sales, some poultry industry associations held a "Chicken and Egg Mela" in Hyderabad. Several Telangana state ministers were in attendance and ate some of the free eggs and fried chicken being distributed at the event to show their support for the industry.[382]
A Muslim cleric stated that Allah has punished the Chinese by unleashing coronavirus on them for their brutal crackdown on Uighur Muslims.[383] The Chinese consulate in Kolkata also condemned similar statements reportedly made by Dilip Ghosh, president of the West Bengal unit of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.[384]
Some politicians claimed that drinking cow urine and applying cow dung on the body could cure coronavirus.[385][386] WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan rubbished such claims and criticised these politicians for spreading misinformation.[387][388]
Reports of harassment of people from Northeast India, which shares a border with Tibet and Myanmar, in Chennai, Pune and Hyderabad were reported following the outbreak.[389][390][391] Students from Kirori Mal College in Delhi, Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai and other institutes in Kolkata have also faced harassment and filed complaints with authorities.[392][393][394]
Misinformation that the government is spreading "anti-corona" drug in the country during Janata curfew went viral on social media.[395] Film actor Mohanlal and many others shared the fake news that, the vibration generated by clapping together during Janata curfew will kill the virus.[396] One viral message says that the lifetime of coronavirus is only 12 hours and staying home for 14 hours during Janata curfew break the chain of transmission.[397] Another message claimed that observing Janata curfew will result in the reduction of coronavirus cases by 40%.[397] A tweet by Rajinikanth claiming that a 14-hour stay home can stop the coronavirus disease going from "stage 2" to "stage 3" was classified as misinformation and was taken down by Twitter for violating community guidelines.[398] Amitabh Bachchan was heavily criticised for one of his tweets, which claimed vibrations from clapping, blowing conch shells as part of Sunday's Janata Curfew would have reduced or destroyed coronavirus potency as it was ‘amavasya’, the darkest day of the month.[399]
Residents of a village named Korauna in Sitapur district in Uttar Pradesh faced discrimination due to similarity in name of the village with the virus.[400]
Some doctors and medical workers were evicted from their homes over fears they may be carrying coronavirus. In cases reported across the country, healthcare professionals described the growing stigma they are facing from their neighbours and landlords, resulting in many being refused taxis, barricaded from their own homes, or made homeless.[401][402]
In March 2020, foreigners from countries such as UK, US and Israel were facing hostility, including evictions from rented homes.[403]
Some patients, in different quarantine facilities of Uttar Pradesh, refused to eat food because the cooks in these facilities were Dalits.[404][405]
The Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi and the resulting hotspot triggered Islamophobic reactions and increased communal tension.[406][407][408] Islamophobic hashtags began circulating shortly after the news broke in late March.[409]
Rajasthan Congress MLA Bharat Singh Kundanpur in a letter to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot claimed that "when coronavirus can be removed by washing hands with alcohol, then drinking alcohol will surely remove virus from the throat." His claim was rubbished by several health experts and doctors.[410]
Three Sikh men in Chembur, Mumbai were brutally attacked by a stranger for asking him to wear a mask while in public places as ordered by the government. One man was later admitted to a nearby hospital. This incident gave rise to Sikh-Muslim communal tension in the area. The accused was arrested by Mumbai Police.[411][412]
Ramdev claimed that one can treat coronavirus by pouring mustard oil through the nose, making the virus flowing into the stomach, resulting in its ultimate death by the acid present in the stomach. He also claimed that if a person holds his breath for a minute, it means s/he is not suffering from any type of coronavirus, symptomatic or asymtomatic. Both these claims were found to be false.[413][414]
When migrant workers returned to their hometowns and villages following the loss of employment in cities, they were treated with class bias. In some cases, they were hosed down with disinfectants or soap solution.[415] They were feared to be carrying coronavirus from the urban areas where they had been employed.[416] Since many of them belonged to the lower castes, they had to face caste slurs.[417]
A report titled "India: Media’s Crackdown during COVID-19 Lockdown" was published on 15 June 2020. Many sources state that at least 55 journalists have been heavily cracked down on for reporting on COVID-19, with FIRs being filed against them under various Acts. [418][419][420][421][422] The charges have been levied for reporting starvation faced by migrant workers, the failure of the administration to supply rations, mismanagement and negligence at quarantine centres[421], or any other reporting that is construed as 'anti-government'.

On 4 April 2020, it was reported that 15 Indians died abroad due to COVID-19. The 15 dead people included 6 in the United States, 5 in Italy, 2 in United Arab Emirates and one each in Egypt and Iran.[425] It was reported on 6 April that four Indians who belonged to the state of Kerala, died in abroad due to COVID-19. The four people were 54-year-old nurse in Ireland, 21-year-old student in New York, 51-year-old employee in Queens, New York and 41-year-old driver in Saudi Arabia.[426] On 11 April, it was reported that over 1,500 Indian Americans were infected and more than 40 Indian Americans and Indian nationals died due to the disease.[427] The Ministry of External Affairs have confirmed that there are 3,336 confirmed Indians cases abroad and 25 have died as of 16 April across 53 countries.[428] On 24 April, the NHS revealed that at least 420 people of Indian origin died due to the disease.[429] On 26 April, officials confirmed that the confirmed cases of Indians abroad has increased to 6,300 with 40 deaths.[430]
As of 19 May, the NHS England reported that 695 members of the non-white community categorised as ‘Indian’ died due to the disease.[431] On 25 May, it was reported that a 50-year-old Indian school teacher of Hindi subject who worked at a school in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, died due to the disease.[432]
On 7 June, it was reported that a 61-year-old Indian doctor, who worked at a hospital in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, died.[433] According to the study of the University of Edinburgh, Indians and South Asians in the UK are likely to die due to COVID-19.[434] As of 25 June 763 people of Indian origin died in the UK, according to the NHS.[435]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of sense of smell.[9][15][16] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[17] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.[18][19] There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.[9] Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.[20]
Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, wearing a face mask in public settings, disinfecting surfaces, increasing ventilation and air filtration indoors,[21] and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.[9][22] Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures. Many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons.
The pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption,[23] including the largest global recession since the Great Depression[24] and global famines affecting 265 million people.[25] It has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events,[26] widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying,[27][28][29] and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases.[30][31] Schools, universities, and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 172 countries, affecting approximately 98.5 percent of the world's student population.[32] Misinformation about the virus has circulated through social media and mass media.[33] There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and against those perceived as being Chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates.[34]
On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) got reports from health authorities in China of a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei,[341][342] and an investigation was launched at the start of January 2020.[343] On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)—7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five WHO regions.[344][7]
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.[354][355] Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.[356][357][358] On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested a case traced back to 17 November 2019 (a 55-year-old from Hubei) may have been the first person infected.[359][360]
The WHO recognised the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020[8] as Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan reported surging cases. The total numbers outside China quickly surpassed China's.[361]
Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.[362] As of 24 May, countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2.6 percent of their population, while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17.3 percent of its population.[363] Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[364][365] An analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 January estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases.[366] Several other studies, using a variety of methods, have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases.[367][368]
On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, tested positive for antibodies.[369] Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported.[370][371] However, such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests, and due to false positives. Some results (such as the Gangelt study) have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review.[372]
Analysis by age in China indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20.[373] It is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested.[374] A retrospective cohort study in China found that children were as likely to be infected as adults.[375] Countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a younger age distribution of cases, relative to the wider population.[376]
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 in January were between 1.4 and 2.5,[377] but a subsequent analysis concluded that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3.8 to 8.9).[378] R0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number (commonly just called R), which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity. By mid-May 2020, the effective R was close to or below 1.0 in many countries, meaning the spread of the disease in these areas at that time was stable or decreasing.[379]

Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the onset of symptoms and death usually ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[384] As of 17 July 2020, approximately 592,000[5] deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. In China, as of 14 June, about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60, and 75 percent had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.[385]
The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[386] The first death outside of China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines,[387] and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.[388]
Official deaths from COVID-19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols. This may ignore deaths of people who die without having been tested.[389] Conversely, deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting.[390] Comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries.[391][392] In the worst affected areas, mortality has been several times higher than average. In New York City, deaths have been four times higher than average, in Paris twice as high, and in many European countries, deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal.[391] This excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery.[393]
Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[394] These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[395][396][397] time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[398] Some countries (like Belgium) include deaths from suspected cases of COVID-19, regardless of whether the person was tested, resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test-confirmed cases.[399]
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 4.3 percent (592,573 deaths for 13,885,746 cases) as of 17 July 2020.[5] The number varies by region.[400]
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Our World in Data states that as of 25 March 2020 the IFR cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths, is known.[398] In February the Institute for Disease Modeling estimated the IFR as 0.94 percent (95-percent confidence interval 0.37–2.9), based on data from China.[401][402] The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) estimated a global CFR of 0.8 to 9.6 percent (last revised 30 April) and IFR of 0.10 percent to 0.41 percent (last revised 2 May), acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics.[403] The CDC estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 1.1 percent and that 40 percent of infected individuals are asymptomatic, for an overall infection fatality rate of 0.65 percent (0.5 to 0.8 percent).[404][405] Serology-informed IFR in Geneva, Switzerland is 0.64 percent (0.38 to 0.98 percent).[406]

On 11 March 2020, the WHO said the pandemic could be controlled.[8] The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location. Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts. But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be."[409] The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".[410] William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said because the coronavirus is "so readily transmissible", it "might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year". The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.[411]
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, and is most commonly five days.[9][413] Some infected people have no symptoms, known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers; transmission from such a carrier is considered possible.[414] As at 6 April, estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 percent.[415]
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific; the two most common symptoms are fever (88 percent) and dry cough (68 percent). Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, loss of taste, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing out blood, diarrhea, and rash.[416][17][16]
Among those who develop symptoms, approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.[9] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[16] Further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and kidney failure.[17]
People are most infectious when they show symptoms (even mild or non-specific symptoms), but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear (pre-symptomatic transmission).[12] They remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases.[12] People can also transmit the virus without showing any symptom (asymptomatic transmission), but it is unclear how often this happens.[9][10][12] A June 2020 review found that 40–45% of infected people are asymptomatic.[417]
COVID-19 spreads primarily when people are in close contact and one person inhales small droplets produced by an infected person (symptomatic or not) coughing, sneezing, talking, or singing.[12][418] The WHO recommends 1 metre (3 ft) of social distance;[9] the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 metres (6 ft).[10] Transmission may also occur through aerosols, smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.[14] Some medical procedures performed on COVID-19 patients in health facilities can generate those smaller droplets. Some outbreaks have also been reported in crowded and inadequately ventilated indoor locations where infected persons spend long periods of time (such as restaurants and nightclubs).[419] Aerosol transmission in such locations has not been ruled out.[14]
COVID-19 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of infected secretions or CT imaging of the chest.[434][435]
The standard test for current infection with SARS-CoV-2 uses RNA testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab, though it is possible to test other samples. This test uses real-time rRT-PCR which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[436]
A number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection.[437] Several have been evaluated by Public Health England and approved for use in the UK.[438]
On 22 June 2020, UK health secretary Matt Hancock announced the country would conduct a new "spit test" for COVID-19 on 14,000 key workers and their families in Southampton, having them spit in a pot, which was collected by Southampton University, with results expected within 48 hours. Hancock said the test was easier than using swabs, and could enable people to conduct it at home.[439]
Characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[440] Many groups have created COVID-19 datasets that include imagery such as the Italian Radiological Society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[441] Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rRT-PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.[440] A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.[435]
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue, and putting the tissue directly into a waste container. Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.[442][443] Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.[444][445] Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.[446][447]
Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from areas affected by the outbreak.[448] The virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.[449]
Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.[450] There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organisations are working to develop one.[451]
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.[22] CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.[442] The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[443][452] It is not clear whether washing hands with ash, if soap is not available, is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections.[453]
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[443][454][455] Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[456][457] Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic.[458]
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10.[459] On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.[460] A Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local conditions vary.[455]
Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.[461][462]
In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance. The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means.[463][464] Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for the pandemic, which include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with, and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.[465][466]
The CDC and WHO recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.[467][468][469] This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing.[468][470] Face coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, breathing, and coughing.[468][470] Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.[471][472]
Masks are also strongly recommended for those who may have been infected and those taking care of someone who may have the disease.[473] When not wearing a mask, the CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.[442] Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.[442] Healthcare professionals interacting directly with COVID-19 patients are advised to use respirators at least as protective as NIOSH-certified N95 or equivalent, in addition to other personal protective equipment.[474]
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[476][477]
Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations.[478][479] The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.[480] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[9][18][481]
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 percent ethanol, 50–100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 percent hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5 percent povidone-iodine. Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.[482] Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used.[21] The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[483]
The CDC recommends ventilation of all public spaces to help dilute and clear out potentially infectious aerosols.[21][484] This can be achieved by increasing the percentage of outside air, increasing the total airflow to occupied spaces, disabling demand-control ventilation (DCV) controls, and using natural ventilation (e.g., opening windows and doors if possible and safe).[21] The CDC recommends bathroom fans be working and at full capacity when people are in a building.[21]
The CDC recommends enhancing filtration in heating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems as part of an overall risk mitigation plan, which should be designed in consultation with a professional or it may be counterproductive.[21] Doctors have been cautious about recommending air filtration because of the potentially very small size of virus particles; some filters are labelled to remove viruses to the 5-micron level, but some virus particles may be even smaller.[485] The CDC recommends increasing air filtration as high as is possible (MERV 13 or 14) without reducing design airflow; this may require replacing the current HVAC system with one that can better handle such filters, which create more resistance to air flow.[21] Other recommendations include using appropriate, correctly installed filters, running ventilation systems continuously, and creating separate ventilation zones for higher and lower risk areas of the building (e.g., individual offices on a different zone than office gym).[21] Another option may be to add freestanding air cleaners, especially in areas where virus particles are likely to be most concentrated.[21][486] In July, researchers at the University of Houston said they had designed a filter using nickel foam which used heat to kill the virus.[487] Some experts have recommended UV light inside HVAC systems.[488]
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are screening, containment (or suppression) and mitigation. Screening is done with a device such as a thermometer to detect the elevated body temperature associated with fevers caused by the coronavirus.[493] Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures to stop the disease from spreading. When it is no longer possible to contain the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and on society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.[494] Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.[410]
Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.[489] This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.[489] Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.[495]
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.[496] Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.[497]
Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.[410]
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.[498] The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.[499]
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.[499] (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.)[499]
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography.[500][501] The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms.[502] In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.[503]
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.[504] The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.[504][505] In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually.[506][507][508]
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.[509][510] In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse-engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight.[511][512][513] On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.[514][515]
Antiviral medications are under investigation for COVID-19[516] None has yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials.[516] However, remdesivir may affect the time it takes to recover from the virus.[517] Emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the U.S. on 1 May, for people hospitalised with severe COVID-19.[518] The interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments, and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks.[518][519]
Taking over-the-counter cold medications,[520] drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.[442] Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.[521] The safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a treatment option requires further research.[522]
Other trials are investigating whether existing medications can be used effectively against COVID-19 or the immune reaction to it.[516][523] On 16 June, the RECOVERY Trial group released a statement that their preliminary results show low dose dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients receiving respiratory support,[524] though previous reviews had suggested the use of steroids may worsen outcomes.[525] Demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint.[526]
There are several theories about when and where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[527] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province.[359] There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were "patient zero".[359] Starting from December, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[528] and at least 266 by 31 December.[529]
According to official Chinese sources, these early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[346] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating the market was not the source of the initial outbreak.[530]
On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[531] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[532]
On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated that there was an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. Eight of those doctors, including Li Wenliang (who was also punished on 3 January),[533] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[534] That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions about "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[535] The next day, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause, confirming 27 cases[341][536][537]—enough to trigger an investigation.[343]
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[538] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[432] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[539] A retrospective official study published in March found that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January (most of them would be diagnosed later)[540] and more may have been infected.[541] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".[356][542] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.[541] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times[clarification needed].[543]
On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[544] As of 13 March 2020, the WHO considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[545] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.[546] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[547] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[548] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[549][550] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[551]
On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case being officially reported,[552] the city of Beijing reported a single COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[553] As for 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed.[554] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[552][555]
On 29 June 2020, WHO warned that the spread of the virus is still accelerating as countries reopen their economies, although many countries have made progress in slowing down the spread.[556]
As of 17 July 2020, more than 13.8 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 592,000 people have died and more than 7.77 million have recovered.[557][558]
A total of 188[5] countries and territories have had at least one case of COVID-19 so far. Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.[559] National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns).[560]
By 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown,[561] which increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the world's population.[562][563]
By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, including but not limited to Italy, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America.[564] Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 percent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States,[565] around 100 million people in the Philippines,[564] about 59 million people in South Africa,[566] and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.[567][568] On 21 May 100,000 new infections occurred worldwide, the most since the start of the pandemic, while overall 5 million cases were surpassed.[569]
As of 19 May 2020, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Turkmenistan and North Korea, although these countries likely also have cases.[570][571] Despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak, the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, particularly South Korea,[572] Taiwan,[573] and Vietnam,[574] has allowed them to fare comparatively well.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan;[354] one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.[359] Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 December, upon which her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[575][576] Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.[575] A public notice was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December, confirming 27 cases and suggesting wearing face masks.[537] The WHO was informed on the same day.[341] As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.[577] The Chinese National Health Commission initially said there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.[578] In a 14 January conference call, Chinese officials said privately that human-to-human transmission was a possibility, and pandemic preparations were needed.[579] In a briefing posted during the night of 14–15 January, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out.[580]
On 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus.[581] That same day, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping and State Council premier Li Keqiang issued their first public comments about the virus, telling people in infected areas to practice social distancing and avoid travel.[582][583] During the Chinese New Year travel period, authorities instigated a City of Wuhan lockdown.[584] On 10 February the Chinese government launched a radical campaign described by paramount leader and Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi as a "people's war" to contain the viral spread.[585] In "the largest quarantine in human history",[586] a cordon sanitaire on 23 January stopped travel in and out of Wuhan,[587][588] then extended to fifteen Hubei cities affecting about 57 million people.[589] Private vehicle use was banned in the city.[590] Several Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were also cancelled.[591] Authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, completed in ten days.[592] Leishenshan Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.[593] China also converted other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.[594]
On 26 January, the government instituted further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.[596] Universities and schools around the country were also closed.[597][598][599] The regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities.[600] Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions.[601] Travel restrictions were enacted in and outside of Hubei.[601][602] Public transport was modified,[603] and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.[601][604][605] Control of public movement was applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction.[606] In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs.[607] Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.[608][609]
After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus re-entering China from other countries. For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.[610] At the same time, a strong anti-foreigner sentiment quickly took hold,[611] and foreigners experienced harassment by the general public[612] and forced evictions from apartments and hotels.[613][614]
On 24 March, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.[615] The same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.[616] The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end. Those wishing to enter China must to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.[617][618] The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for firms.[619]
The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 4 April, coinciding with Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online in observance of physical distancing to avoid a renewed COVID-19 outbreak.[620] On 25 April the last patients were discharged in Wuhan.[621] On 13 May the city of Jilin was put on lockdown, sparking fear of a second wave of infection.[622]
The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia,[623] and has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States and Brazil[624] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May, 200,000 on 3 June, [625][626] and 1,000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020.
India's case fatality rate is relatively lower at 2.80%, against the global 4.7%, as of 6 July.[627] Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country – Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[628] As of 24 May 2020, Lakshadweep is the only region which has not reported a case. On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time reducing 49% of total infections[629] followed by recovery rate crossing 60% till early July. Although, active have continued to increase persistently.
On 22 March, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi. It was followed by mandatory lockdowns in COVID-19 hotspots and all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the Prime Minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India. On 14 April, the PM extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May which was followed by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17 May with substantial relaxations. From 1 June, the Government has started "unlocking" the country (barring "containment zones") in three unlock phases.[630][631][632][633][634][635][636]
Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February.[658][659] More than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating the outbreak may have been more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.[659][660] The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March.[661] On 15 March, the Iranian government reported a hundred deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.[662] At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March.[663] By 23 March, Iran was experiencing fifty new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.[664] According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported. It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.[665] The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.[666] On 20 April it was reported that Iran had reopened shopping malls and other shopping areas across the country, though there is a fear of the second wave of infection due to this move.[667] After reaching a low in new cases in early May, a new peak was reported on 4 June, raising fear of a second wave.[668]
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China. The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February,[669] largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.[669][670] Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.[671][672] By 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13 percent reported symptoms.[673]
South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.[674] On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported,[675] rising to 3,150 on 29 February.[676] All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests showed three soldiers had the virus.[671] Airline schedules were also changed.[677][678]
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organised programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate any infected people, and trace and quarantine those who contacted them.[572][679] Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application,[680] drive-through testing for the virus with the results available the next day,[681] and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.[682] South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.[572][683][684]
South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis, many signing petitions either praising it or calling for impeachment.[685] On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.[682] On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.[686] Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.[687] On 15 May it was reported that about two thousand businesses were told to close again when a cluster of a hundred infected individuals was discovered; contact tracing is being done on 11,000 people.[688]
As of 13 March 2020, when the number of new cases became greater than those in China, the World Health Organization (WHO) began to consider Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[689][690] Cases by country across Europe had doubled over periods of typically 3 to 4 days, with some countries (mostly those at earlier stages of detection) showing doubling every 2 days.[691]
As of 17 March, all countries within Europe had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with Montenegro being the last European country to report at least one case.[692] At least one death has been reported in all European countries, apart from the Vatican City.
As of 18 March, more than 250 million people were in lockdown in Europe.[693]
On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from eleven different municipalities in northern Italy.[699] Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided. Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas."[700][701]
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached a hundred deaths. All major sporting events were to be held behind closed doors until April,[702] but on 9 March all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.[703] On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.[704][705]
On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols.[706][707][708] On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.[709][710] On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.[711] As of 12 June, there were 236,305 confirmed cases, 34,223 deaths, and 173,085 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.[361] A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.[712] On 19 April, it was reported that the country had its lowest deaths at 433 in seven days and some businesses are asking for a loosening of restrictions after six weeks of lockdown.[713]
The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands.[714] Post-hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least 15 strains of the virus had been imported, and community transmission began by mid-February.[715] By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country.
The lockdown was imposed on 14 March 2020.[716] On 29 March, it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next 14 days.[717] By late March, the Community of Madrid has recorded the most cases and deaths in the country. Medical professionals and those who live in retirement homes have experienced especially high infection rates.[718] On 25 March, the death toll in Spain surpassed that of mainland China, and only that of Italy was higher.[719] On 2 April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period—at the time, the most by any country in a single day.[720] On 17 May, the daily death toll announced by the Spanish government fell below 100 for the first time,[721] and 1 June was the first day without deaths by coronavirus.[722] The state of alarm ended on 21 June.[723]
Prior to 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.[732][733] As a result, the government was criticised for a perceived lack of intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.[734][735]
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.[736][737] On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible,[738] and promised to pay up to 80 percent of workers' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.[739]
On 23 March, the prime minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary. Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings. Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for those deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations, and garages.[740]
On 24 April it was reported that one of the more promising vaccine trials had begun in England; the government has pledged, in total, more than 50 million pounds towards research.[741]
To ensure UK health services had sufficient capacity to treat people with COVID-19, a number of temporary critical care hospitals were built.[742] The first to be operational was the 4000-bed capacity NHS Nightingale Hospital London, constructed within the ExCeL convention centre over nine days.[743] On 4 May, it was announced that the Nightingale Hospital in London would be placed on standby and remaining patients transferred to other facilities.[744] This followed reports that NHS Nightingale in London "treated 51 patients" within the first three weeks of opening.[745] On 5 May, official figures revealed that Britain had the worst COVID-19 death toll in Europe, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The death toll in the United Kingdom was nearly 29,427 (of those who tested positive for the virus). Later, it was calculated at 32,313, after taking the official death count for Scotland and Northern Ireland into account.[746] On 16 April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine, due to a prior contract; should the trial be successful, some 30 million doses in the UK would be available.[747]
Although it was originally thought the pandemic reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in Europe was confirmed in Bordeaux, it was later discovered that a person near Paris had tested positive for the virus on 27 December 2019 after retesting old samples.[549][550] A key event in the spread of the disease in the country was the annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse, which was attended by about 2,500 people, at least half of whom are believed to have contracted the virus.[748][749]
On 13 March, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe ordered the closure of all non-essential public places,[750] and on 16 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced mandatory home confinement, a policy which was extended at least until 11 May.[751][752][753] As of 23 April, France has reported more than 120,804 confirmed cases, 21,856 deaths, and 42,088 recoveries,[754] ranking fourth in number of confirmed cases.[755] In April, there were riots in some Paris suburbs.[756] On 18 May, it was reported that schools in France had to close again after reopening, due to COVID-19 case flare-ups.[757]
Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open.[758] Per the Swedish Constitution, the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy which prevents political interference and the agency's policy favoured forgoing a lockdown in an attempt to reach herd immunity.[759] The New York Times said that, as of May 2020, the outbreak had been far deadlier there but the economic impact had been reduced as Swedes have continued to go to work, restaurants, and shopping.[758][760] On 19 May, it was reported that the country had in the week of 12–19 May the highest per capita deaths in Europe, 6.25 deaths per million per day.[761]
On 20 January 2020, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who had returned from Wuhan on 15 January.[762] On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency,[763] and restricted entry for travellers from China who were not U.S. citizens.[764]
On 28 January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced they had developed their own testing kit.[765] Despite this, the United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the extent of the outbreak.[766][767] Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government test kits, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test.[766][767]
By 2 March there were 80 confirmed cases, half of them in California. Florida and New York had declared their first two cases and the state of Washington reported many suspected cases and the first death. Vice President Pence maintained that the threat of the virus spreading throughout the U.S. was small.[768][769][770]
On 6 March, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.[771][772] Corporations encouraged employees to work from home.[773] Sports events and seasons were cancelled.[26]
On 13 March, Trump declared a national emergency, which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis.[774] Beginning on 15 March, many businesses closed or reduced hours[775] and schools across the country were shutting down.[776][777] By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all fifty states and in the District of Columbia.[778] On 26 March, the United States had more confirmed cases than any other country.[547] U.S. federal health inspectors surveyed 323 hospitals in late March; reporting "severe shortages" of test supplies, "widespread shortages" of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other strained resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results.[779]
On 22 April, it was reported that two Californians had died from the virus (not, as previously thought, influenza) on 6 and 17 February, three weeks before the first official COVID-19 death in the U.S. had been acknowledged.[551] By 24 April, 889,309 cases had been confirmed and 50,256 people had died.[780] As of 17 May, according to a New York Times database, more than 1,474,600 people had been infected and at least 88,600 had died in the United States. The Times said that prior to 29 April only deaths confirmed through testing were reported, but new criteria include probable cases and deaths. As of 17 May, the U.S., which accounts for about 4.25 percent of the world's population, had about 29 percent of the confirmed coronavirus deaths.[781]
The White House has been criticised for downplaying the threat and controlling the messaging, directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence.[782] On 14 April, President Trump halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), saying they mismanaged the pandemic. He also said the U.S. would not participate in a global effort with the WHO to develop a vaccine and drugs to combat the virus.[783] On 1 May the CDC presented a 17-page report titled "Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework" to the administration, written to provide advice for faith leaders, places of business and other public places, educators, and state and local officials as they reopened. The White House refused to use the report, and Trump said he felt the guidelines were too restrictive, commenting "I see the new normal being what it was three months ago. I think we want to go back to where it was."[784][785]
By mid-May reports of new cases began to level off and most states began to open restaurants and other places of business, placing limits to the numbers of people allowed in the establishment at the same time. The head of the NIAID, Anthony Fauci, warned that if caution was not used the rate of infections could rebound and he was particularly concerned about opening the schools in the fall. President Trump expressed disapproval of Fauci's statements, saying "To me it's not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools."[786] By mid-June, new cases began to rise once again, with increases in the percent of positive tests and number of hospitalizations occurring in states such as Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona.[787] On 12 July, almost 6 months after the first case was recognised in the U.S., the highest single day case record of 15,300 infections were recorded in Florida.[788]
On 6 July 2020, the United States president Donald Trump's administration sent a notice to the United Nations Secretary General António Guterres to withdraw from the World Health Organization. The notice of withdrawal was to come in effect from 6 July 2021, under the terms of a joint resolution passed by Congress in 1948, where United States was required to give one-year notice and clear its debts to leave the WHO.[789]
On April 17, the highest number of cases and deaths was registered in Brazil,[792] followed by Peru and Chile in the number of confirmed cases.[793]
On May 13, it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over 400,000 cases of infection with 23,091 deaths. On May 22, citing especially the rapid increase of infections in Brazil, the WHO declared that South America is presently the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.[794][795]
On 20 May it was reported that Brazil had a record 1,179 deaths in a single day, for a total of almost 18,000 fatalities. With a total number of almost 272,000 cases, Brazil became the country with the third-highest number of cases, following Russia and the United States.[797] On 25 May, Brazil exceeded the number of reported cases in Russia when they reported that 11,687 new cases had been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number to over 374,800, with more than 23,400 deaths. President Jair Bolsonaro has created a great deal of controversy referring to the virus as a "little flu" and frequently speaking out against preventive measures such as lockdowns and quarantines. His attitude towards the outbreak has so closely matched that of U.S. president Donald Trump he has been called the "Trump of the Tropics".[798]
In June 2020, the government of Brazil attempted to conceal the actual figures of the COVID-19 active cases and deaths, as it stopped publishing the total number of infections and deaths. On 5 June, Brazil's health ministry took down the official website reflecting the total numbers of infections and deaths. The website was live on 6 June, with only the number of infections of previous 24 hours. The last official numbers reported about 615,000 infections and over 34,000 deaths.[799] On 15 June, it was reported that the worldwide cases had jumped from seven to eight million in one week, citing Latin America, specifically Brazil as one of the countries where cases are surging, in this case, towards 1 million cases.[800]
According to Michael Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, early detection is vital because the continent's health systems "are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks".[801][802] Advisers say that a strategy based on testing could allow African countries to minimise lockdowns that inflict enormous hardship on those who depend on income earned day by day to be able to feed themselves and their families. Even in the best scenario, the United Nations says 74 million test kits and 30,000 ventilators will be needed by the continent's 1.3 billion people in 2020.[803] Most of the reported cases are from six countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco, Egypt and Algeria, but it is believed that there is widespread under-reporting in other African countries with poorer health care systems.[804] Cases have been confirmed in all African countries, with Lesotho the last country to report its first coronavirus case on 13 May 2020.[805] There have been no reported cases in the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.[806]
On 19 May 2020, Australia filed a motion with the UN for an inquiry into the origins of the virus, and the response of the UN and governments. More than 100 countries supported this motion, and it was passed unanimously.[809][810]
As a result of the pandemic, many countries and regions imposed quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas,[811] or for all travellers.[812] Together with a decreased willingness to travel, this had a negative economic and social impact on the travel sector. Concerns have been raised over the effectiveness of travel restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19.[813] A study in Science found that travel restrictions had only modestly affected the initial spread of COVID-19, unless combined with infection prevention and control measures to considerably reduce transmissions.[814] Researchers concluded that "travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late".[815]
The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone and introducing border controls with Italy,[816][817] a decision which has been criticised by some European politicians.[818][819]
Owing to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries evacuated their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, primarily through chartered flights of the home nation, with Chinese authorities providing clearance. Canada, the United States, Japan, India,[820] Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first to plan the evacuation of their citizens.[821] Brazil and New Zealand also evacuated their own nationals and some other people.[822][823] On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative for the virus from Wuhan, while four who showed symptoms were left behind to mitigate risk.[824] Pakistan said it would not evacuate citizens from China.[825]
On 15 February, the U.S. announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess,[826] and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadian passengers from the ship.[827] In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran.[828][829] On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.[830]
Some Chinese students at American universities sent aid, including 50,000 N95 masks on 30 January.[831] The humanitarian aid organisation Direct Relief sent 200,000 face masks and other personal protective equipment to the Wuhan Union Hospital the same day.[832] On 5 February, the Chinese foreign ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China,[833] and Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts and protect "at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia".[834] Interaksyon said the Chinese government had donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6 February after Philippine senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.[835] On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send $2.26 million worth of aid to China.[836]
Several countries donated masks, medical equipment or money to China, including Japan,[837] Turkey, Russia,[838] Malaysia,[839] Germany,[840] and Canada.[841][842] The U.S. State Department said on 7 February it had facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China.[843] The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to aid their fights against the virus,[844] though on 21 March China said it had not received epidemic funding from the U.S. government and reiterated that on 3 April.[citation needed] Several corporations have also donated money or medical equipment to China.[845]
After cases in China stabilised, the country began sending aid to other nations.[846] In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak;[847][848] China sent three medical teams and donated more than forty tons of medical supplies to Italy.[849] Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union.[850][851] He later sent 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ventilators to Panama.[852]
The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concerns over Chinese-made masks and test kits.[853] For instance, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits with an accuracy rate of 30 percent, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 Chinese face masks which were said to be defective,[854] but China said this was due to misuse.[855] Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China but were in fact from Colombia.[856] The Philippines stopped using test kits donated by China due to their 40 percent accuracy.[857] The Chinese government said product instructions might not have been followed, and that some products were not purchased directly from certified companies.[858] Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa.[859][860] On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.[861] According to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Turkey provides the largest amount of humanitarian aid in the world while ranking third worldwide in supplying medical aid.[862][863]
Taiwan posted an inquiry to the WHO on 31 December 2019.[864][865] The WHO has commended the Chinese authorities for providing "regular updates", contrasting it to the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak when they were accused of secrecy.[866] The WHO said on 5 January that cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported,[867] and issued technical briefings on 10 and 11 January warning of risks of human-to-human transmission and urging precautions due to the similarity to earlier SARS and MERS outbreaks.[868] though in public announcements it said there was "no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission" as late as 14 January.[869] On 20 January, the WHO said it was "now very clear" human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had occurred, given that healthcare workers had been infected.[870] On 27 January, the WHO assessed the risk of the outbreak to be "high at the global level".[871]
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), warning that "all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread" of the virus,[7][872] following an increase in cases outside China. This was the sixth-ever PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems" but that the WHO did not "recommend limiting trade and movement".[7][873][874]
On 11 February, the WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres agreed to provide the "power of the entire UN system in the response". A UN Crisis Management Team was activated, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations, which the WHO said will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak".[875] On 25 February, the WHO declared "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," stating that while it was too early to call it a pandemic, countries should be "in a phase of preparedness".[876] On 28 February, WHO officials said the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.[877] On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.[878] The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".[8] Critics have said the WHO handled the pandemic inadequately and that the PHEIC and pandemic classification came too late.[879] The third meeting of the WHO Emergency Committee on 30 April renewed the declaration of PHEIC for the second time.[880]
The outbreak is a major destabilising threat to the global economy. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer image emerges on potential outcomes. One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.[881] Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside China.[882][883] On 27 February, due to mounting worries about the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. stock indexes posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points (the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08)[884] and all three major indexes ending the week down more than 10 percent.[885] On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a Negative Outlook.[886] Stocks plunged again due to coronavirus fears, the largest fall being on 16 March.[887] Many consider an economic recession likely.[888][889]
Lloyd's of London has estimated that the global insurance industry will absorb losses of US$204 billion, exceeding the losses from the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season and 9/11, suggesting the COVID-19 pandemic will likely go down in history as the costliest disaster ever in human history.[890]
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and British regional airline Flybe collapsed.[891] The cruise line industry was hard hit,[892] and several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.[893] International mail between some countries stopped or was delayed due to reduced transportation between them or suspension of domestic service.[894]
The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.[895] Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 percent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 percent drop.[896] This also resulted in a 33–43 percent drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February. Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.[897]
Hundreds of millions of jobs could be lost globally.[898][899] More than 40 million Americans lost their jobs and filed unemployment insurance claims.[900] According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14–22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.[901]
The outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight outbreaks, panic buying (which in several places led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water), and disruption to factory and logistic operations.[902] The spread of panic buying has been found to stem from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. social influence and trust).[903] The technology industry, in particular, has warned of delays to shipments of electronic goods.[904] According to the WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen a hundredfold, leading to prices up to twenty times the normal price and also delays in the supply of medical items of four to six months.[905][906] It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.[907]
The impact of the coronavirus outbreak was worldwide. The virus created a shortage of precursors (raw material) used in the manufacturing of fentanyl and methamphetamine. The Yuancheng Group, headquartered in Wuhan, China, is one of the leading suppliers.[908] Price increases and shortages in these illegal drugs have been noticed on the street of the UK.[909] U.S. law enforcement also told the New York Post Mexican drug cartels were having difficulty in obtaining precursors.[910]
The pandemic has disrupted global food supplies and threatens to trigger a new food crisis.[911][912] David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said "we could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months."[913]
Senior officials at the United Nations estimated in April 2020 that an additional 130 million people could starve, for a total of 265 million by the end of 2020.[914][913][915]
In early February 2020, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.[916] On Monday, 20 April, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) went negative and fell to a record low (minus $37.63 a barrel) due to traders' offloading holdings so as not to take delivery and incur storage costs.[917] June prices were down but in the positive range, with a barrel of West Texas trading above $20.[917]
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organisations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.[918] In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.[919][920][921]
Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, were cancelled.[920] Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; services have been made available via radio, online live streaming and television, though some congregations have made provisions for drive-in worship.[922][923][920] With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims,[920] other religious bodies also cancelled in-person services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.[920] Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed,[650][657] while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.[924][925]
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War. Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League,[926] 2019–20 Premier League,[927] UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season,[928] and 2019–20 NHL season.[929] The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that they will be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021".[930][931]
The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.[932][933] The Eurovision Song Contest, which was due to be held in the Netherlands in May, was cancelled, however the Netherlands was retained as host for 2021.[934][935] Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.[936] Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts[937] or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicise their work.[938] Online, numerous COVID-19-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid the uncertainty.[939]
The pandemic has affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities,[940] isolations or deaths of multiple politicians,[941] and rescheduling of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.[942] Starting in late May, large-scale protests against police brutality in at least 200 U.S. cities and later worldwide in response to the killing of George Floyd raised concerns of a resurgence of the virus.[943]
Although they have broad support among epidemiologists, social distancing measures have been politically controversial in many countries. Intellectual opposition to social distancing has come primarily from writers of other fields, although there are a few heterodox epidemiologists.[944]
The measures taken to combat the pandemic are part of an unusually large expansion of government power. Advocates of small government worry that the state will be reluctant to give up that power once the crisis is over, as has often been the case historically.[945]
The Chinese government has been criticised by the United States government,[946] UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove,[947] and others[948] for its handling of the pandemic. A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine measures in China, a sign of discontent with their response to the outbreak. Some commentators believed this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the controversy.[949] The U.S. intelligence community says China intentionally under-reported its number of coronavirus cases.[950] The Chinese government maintains it has acted swiftly and transparently.[951][952]
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy[953][954]—Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said "only China responded bilaterally", not the EU.[955] On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin had the Russian army send military medics, disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.[956] President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed their gratitude for the aid.[957] Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.[958] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said "when offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."[959] In early April, Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant,[960] and Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country.[961]
The outbreak prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid sick leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.[963][964][965] Political analysts anticipated it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election.[966][967] Beginning in mid-April 2020, there were protests in several U.S. states against government-imposed business closures and restricted personal movement and association.[968]
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.[969][970] The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticised the exercise, saying "it jeopardises the lives not only of the troops from the U.S. and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating."[971]
The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliament members and fifteen current or former political figures infected.[660][972] Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying they were struggling to fight the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets from the United States sanctions against Iran.[973] Saudi Arabia, which launched a military intervention in Yemen in March 2015, declared a ceasefire.[974]
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.[976] South Korea criticised Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.[977] South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis; many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.[685]
Some countries have passed emergency legislation in response to the pandemic. Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.[978][979] In the Philippines, lawmakers granted president Rodrigo Duterte temporary emergency powers during the pandemic.[980] In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.[981] In some countries, including Egypt,[982] Turkey,[983] and Thailand,[980] opposition activists and government critics have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic.[984]
The pandemic, alongside lockdowns and travel restrictions, has prevented movement of aid and greatly impacted food production. As a result, several famines are forecast, which the United Nations called a crisis "of biblical proportions",[985] or "hunger pandemic".[986] It is estimated that without intervention 30 million people may die of hunger, with Oxfam reporting that "12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger" by the end of 2020.[14][985][987] This pandemic, in conjunction with the 2019-20 locust infestations and several ongoing armed conflicts, is predicted to form the worst series of famines since the Great Chinese Famine, affecting between 10 and 20 percent of the global population in some way.[988] 55 countries are reported to be at risk, with three dozen succumbing to crisis-level famines or above in the worst-case scenario.[989] 265 million people are forecast to be in famine conditions, an increase of 125 million due to the coronavirus pandemic.[14]
The pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities and colleges.[990]
Most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19.[991] As of 7 June 2020, approximately 1.725 billion learners are currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring, 134 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 38 are implementing local closures, impacting about 98.5 percent of the world's student population. 39 countries' schools are currently open.[992]
On 23 March 2020, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) released a statement announcing the cancellation of Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International AS & A Level, Cambridge AICE Diploma, and Cambridge Pre-U examinations for the May/June 2020 series across all countries.[993] International Baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled.[994] In addition, Advanced Placement Exams, SAT administrations, and ACT administrations have been moved online and cancelled.
School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families.[995] but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences.[996][997] School closures in response to the pandemic have shed light on various social and economic issues, including student debt,[998] digital learning,[999][1000] food insecurity,[1001] and homelessness,[1002][1003] as well as access to childcare,[1004] health care,[1005] housing,[1006] internet,[1007] and disability services.[1008] The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.[32][1009]
The pandemic has had many impacts on global health beyond those caused by the COVID-19 disease itself. It has led to a reduction in hospital visits for other reasons. There have been 38 per cent fewer hospital visits for heart attack symptoms in the United States and 40 per cent fewer in Spain.[1011] The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital."[1012] There is also concern that people with strokes and appendicitis are not seeking timely treatment.[1012] Shortages of medical supplies have impacted people with various conditions.[1013]
In several countries there has been a marked reduction of spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, attributable to COVID-19 quarantines, social distancing measures, and recommendations to not engage in casual sex.[1014][1015] Similarly, in some places, rates of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses significantly decreased during the pandemic.[1016][1017][1018]
The worldwide disruption caused by the pandemic has resulted in numerous impacts on the environment and the climate. The considerable decline in planned travel[1021] has caused many regions to experience a large drop in air pollution. In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a 25 per cent reduction in carbon emissions[1022] and 50 per cent reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions,[1023] which one Earth systems scientist estimated may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months.[1024][1025] Other positive impacts on the environment include governance-system-controlled investments towards a sustainable energy transition and other goals related to environmental protection such as the European Union's seven-year €1 trillion budget proposal and €750 billion recovery plan "Next Generation EU" which seeks to reserve 25% of EU spending for climate-friendly expenditure.[1026][1027][1028][1029][1030]
However, the outbreak has also provided cover for illegal activities such as deforestation of the Amazon rainforest[1031][1032] and poaching in Africa,[1033][1034] hindered environmental diplomacy efforts,[1035] and created economic fallout that some predict will slow investment in green energy technologies.[1036]
Since the start of the outbreak, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been documented around the world toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent.[1037][1038][1039] Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed in groups worldwide about Chinese people deserving the virus.[1040][1041][1042] Chinese people and other Asians in the United Kingdom and United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assaults.[1043][1044][1045] U.S. president Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" and "Kung Flu", which critics say is racist and anti-Chinese.[1046][1047][1048][1049]
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia,[1050][1051] as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread.[1052] Paris has seen riots break out over police treatment of ethnic minorities during the coronavirus lockdown.[1053] Racism and xenophobia towards South Asians and Southeast Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.[1054][1055][1056] South Korea's LGBTQ community was blamed by some for the spread of COVID-19 in Seoul.[1057][1058]
In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents has been inflamed by the pandemic; a comic posted on Weibo described foreigners as "foreign garbage" targeted for "disposal".[1059] Some black people were evicted from their homes by police and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus.[1060] Other harassment, discrimination and evictions of Africans in China were alleged.[1061] This racism and xenophobia was criticised by foreign governments and diplomatic corps and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.[1062] A McDonald's branch in Guangzhou barring blacks sparked anger in China and overseas, and McDonald's closed the location.[1063]
Many newspaper agencies removed their online paywalls for some or all of their coronavirus-related articles and posts,[1064] while scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.[1065] Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.[1066]
The pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease.[1068][1069][1070] False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media,[1069][1071] text messaging,[1072] and mass media,[1073] including the tabloid media,[1074] conservative media,[1075][1076] and state media of countries such as China,[1077][1078] Russia,[1079][1080] Iran,[1081] and Turkmenistan.[1069][1082] It has also been reportedly spread by covert operations backed by states such as Saudi Arabia,[1083] Russia and China to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries.[1084][1085][1086][1087] In some countries, such as India,[1088] Bangladesh,[1089] and Ethiopia,[1090] journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic.[1091]
Misinformation has been propagated by celebrities, politicians[1092][1093] (including heads of state in countries such as the United States,[1094][1095] Iran,[1096] and Brazil[1097][1098]), and other prominent public figures.[1099] Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests, supposed preventives, and "miracle" cures.[1100][1101] Several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus.[1102][1103][1104] Some people have claimed the virus is a bioweapon accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory,[1105][1106] a population-control scheme, the result of a spy operation,[1070][1071][1107] or the side effect of 5G upgrades to cellular networks.[1108]

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei. As of 17 July 2020, more than 13.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 592,000 deaths. More than 7.77 million people have recovered.[1]
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Colloquially known as simply the coronavirus, it was previously referred to by its provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Read more...

The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis. Global stock markets crashed in March 2020, with falls of several percent in the world's major indices. As the pandemic spreads, global conferences and events across technology, fashion, and sports are being cancelled or postponed. While the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing. Read more...
Hazard controls for COVID-19 in US workplaces are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task, based on an occupational risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected person with COVID-19. Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task. Read more...
The pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. False information, including intentional disinformation, has been spread through social media, text messaging, and mass media, including the tabloid media, conservative media, and state media of countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and Turkmenistan. It has also been reportedly spread by covert operations backed by states such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and China to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries. In some countries, such as India, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia, journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic. Read more...
COVID-19 testing involves analyzing samples to assess the current or past presence of SARS-CoV-2. The two main branches detect either the presence of the virus or of antibodies produced in response to infection. Tests for viral presence are used to diagnose individual cases and to allow public health authorities to trace and contain outbreaks. Antibody tests instead show whether someone once had the disease. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. It is used to assess disease prevalence, which aids the estimation of the infection fatality rate. Read more...
